Labour, the SNP, Green party and Plaid Cymru politicians all took the Tories to task for having reduced police numbers by more than 20,000 over the last nine years. Their coordinated attack in the debate hosted by the BBC was a sign that the issue could become problematic for Boris Johnson in the same way that Theresa May was held accountable for falling police numbers in the wake of terror attacks during the 2017 general election campaign. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary representing Labour in the debate, raised the issue of police cuts as she was asked about what should be done to increase security. After paying tribute to the bravery of the emergency services and public in responding to Friday\u2019s attack, she said: \u201cThis was an extreme event but what we can\u2019t ignore is that over recent years we\u2019ve seen increases in violent crime right across the country and at the same time since 2010 we\u2019ve seen over 20,000 police officers cut from frontline services. \u201cIt is right to recognise that that would have a direct impact and of course we\u2019ve got to invest more in community neighbourhood policing and Labour has pledged to do that, but we\u2019ve also got to invest in counter-terrorism measures and make sure they are properly funded.\u201d She was backed up by Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader and first minister of Scotland, who said no amount of police officers could prevent a terror attack but added: \u201cThe numbers of police officers is important in ensuring the speed of response we saw today.

The SNP leader said: \u201cI\u2019m going to be pretty blunt here: when Boris Johnson says the NHS is not on the table in a future trade deal, I simply do not trust him and I do not believe him on that point.\u201d Sunak branded the idea that the NHS would be for sale a \u201cdesperate conspiracy theory\u201d.

In the past it has mostly been Labour Brexiters who have complained about EU state aid rules limiting the ability of the government to use subsidies to help struggling companies, while the Conservatives have been wary of policies that meddle with market economics. But at the news conference Johnson claimed that change was necessary because \u201cthe ramifications of EU state aid rules are felt everywhere\u201d. The <strong>Institute of Directors</strong>, a free-market business organisation, and the <strong>Institute of Economic Affairs</strong>, a libertarian thinktank, both strongly criticised the new Tory approach, with the IoD describing this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/29/general-election-tories-threaten-channel-4-after-climate-debate-ice-stunt-live-news?page=with:block-5de134ae8f08dcf251b4b8f1#block-5de134ae8f08dcf251b4b8f1\">as \u201clike a bad solution in search of the wrong problem\u201d.</a> But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/29/general-election-tories-threaten-channel-4-after-climate-debate-ice-stunt-live-news?page=with:block-5de140338f087410d987544c#block-5de140338f087410d987544c\">the small print of the Conservative announcement</a> suggests that Johnson is planning relatively modest changes to the current regime, rather than a wholesale shift towards 1970s socialism, and it has also been pointed out that any attempt to diverge very far from current EU-style rules would make negotiating a UK-EU free trade deal much harder. At his press conference Johnson also insisted that the Conservatives were the change option at the election, because no other party would take advantages of the opportunities for reform offered by Brexit. There is a full summary of the press conference <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/29/general-election-tories-threaten-channel-4-after-climate-debate-ice-stunt-live-news?page=with:block-5de11d9d8f08cd6fe586e317#block-5de11d9d8f08cd6fe586e317\">here.</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson has praised the police and members of the public who intervened to tackle a terrorist suspect on London Bridge.</strong> The man was shot dead by police.

The UK is not allowed to formally start trade talks with other countries until after it has left the EU, but it wants to have them ready for when the post-Brexit transition period ends, at the end of 2020 according to current plans. Asked how many trade deals had actually been agreed, Johnson replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There are a number that are oven-ready ...

Maybe you can help. Which EU state aid rules would currently stop the UK from helping an important UK company? A few years ago STX the french ship builder was temporarily nationalised to save jobs and put it back on its feet, it was then sold to an italian company with the French state keeping a 33% share. All this was done under EU rules. </p> \n      <p>So when Mr Johnson is talking about EU rules stopping this and Journalists like Mr Islam are backing him up on twitter posts, which EU state aid laws are they refering too?</p>\n     </div> \n    </div> \n   </div> \n  </figure> \n  <p>This is what the Conservative party says on this subject in the briefing note to sent out to journalists explaining the new policy.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>EU state aid law imposes a number of restrictions on the support that the UK can provide to industry. The treaties in principle prohibit \u2018any aid granted by a member state or through state resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings\u2019, which might have an affect on trade between member states <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1456309310818&amp;uri=CELEX:12012E107\">(TFEU, art. 107(1</a>). Aids must be approved by the EU institutions to be lawful (TFEU, <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1456309437379&amp;uri=CELEX:12012E108\">art. 108</a>).</p> \n   <p>This law is notoriously vague. It means the UK government may have to wait months or years for a decision by the European commission. The state aid rules have a chilling effect on government support for industry. An example of this will suffice: the government decided, in response to the steel crisis four years ago, that it would provide aid to certain firms. On 28 October 2015 it was announced that energy intensive industries \u2018will be exempt from the policy costs of the renewable obligation and feed-in tariffs, to ensure that they have long-term certainty and remain competitive\u2019 (Sajid Javid, <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2015-12-17/HCWS410/\">Update on UK steel industry</a>: written statement - HCWS410, 17 December 2015). As a result of EU state aid rules, however, the government was prohibited from implementing its policy until approval was given by the European commission. The commission notified the government of its approval on 17 December 2015 (Sajid Javid, <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2015-12-17/HCWS410/\">Update on UK steel industry</a>: written statement - HCWS410, 17 December 2015). There was therefore a 50 day lag between the government applying for approval and European Commission giving it. According to the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, the EEF, \u2018the [aid] package is worth approximately \u00a345m per annum to the steel sector. In total it is worth approximately \u00a3300m a year to the Energy Intensive sector\u2019 (<a href=\"https://www.eef.org.uk/about-eef/media-news-and-insights/media-releases/2015/dec/uk-steel-comment-on-state-aid-approval-for-eii-package\"><em>EEF</em>, 17 December 2015</a>). On this basis, it can be calculated that the 50 day delay as a result of the EU\u2019s state aid rules cost the steel industry \u00a36.2m and energy intensive industries as a whole \u00a341.1m.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>What is striking about this example is that it suggests Johnson wants a new framework that would give the government a bit more flexibility over state aid - not the opportunity for intervention on a much grander scale than anything allowed now.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de13a858f08cd6fe586e493\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-29T15:38:12.170Z\">3.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>From my colleague <strong>Heather Stewart.</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianHeather/status/1200437710130995200\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Downing Street: the PM is on his way back to No10 from his constituency where he will receive further updates on the London Bridge incident.</p>\u2014 Heather Stewart (@GuardianHeather) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianHeather/status/1200437710130995200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 29, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>My colleague <strong>Matthew Weaver </strong>is covering the London Bridge incident on a separate live blog.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2019/nov/29/london-bridge-incident-police-city\">London Bridge incident 'treated as if terror-related' after five people injured \u2013 live news</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-29T16:14:00.331Z\">at 4.14pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de137e58f08cd6fe586e482\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-29T15:32:59.460Z\">3.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Hugo Dixon</strong> from the anti-Brexit website InFacts says Boris Johnson was wrong to claim in his press conference earlier that the UK needs to leave the EU to abolish the tampon tax.

There will be ways in which we can do things differently and better.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson also claimed state aid rules prevented councils or schools from charging for bus services for pupils, or for the disabled. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>On state aid, the ramifications of EU state aid rules are felt everywhere. I [have] talked to companies, local government or schools that are trying, for instance, to run bus services where they take in some contribution from the passengers. What they find is that they fall foul of state aid rules in so far as they may be deemed, therefore, to be competing with private hire vehicles or private bus companies of one kind or another. So that buses taking kids to school, or helping to move disadvantaged people around the community, are facing real difficulties because of some EU state aid rules.</p> \n   <p>What we will be able to do is be more flexible, be more pragmatic, but also maintain a level playing field. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But, when Johnson was asked if he could give an example of a company that had gone bust in the last decade that might have been saved by the sort of policies that Johnson plans to adopt post-Brexit, he declined to give an example.

(The Tory manifesto rules out an extension). Explaining why he was confident, Johnson said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>And, the advantage that we have in doing that deal, is that we are in a state of grace with the EU at the moment, in the sense that we have complete alignment so far as our regulations go.

Sampling/computing errors? </em><em><br></em></p> \n  <p><em>2. Methodological errors (wrong assumptions in choosing samples)? </em></p> \n  <p><em>3.

Or is the tolerance error itself being subject to a wild and unquantifiable error? Anthony, Maidstone</em></p> \n  <p>Pollsters say their results are right to within three percentage points \u2013 on either side \u2013 95% percent of the time. That means if the Conservatives are polling at 40% then the actual proportion of Tory support will be somewhere between 37% and 43% 19 times out of 20. When you think about it, this leaves a lot of get out.</p> \n  <p>Sampling errors have caused problems in the past when, despite their best efforts, pollsters have not generated a model properly representative of the British population \u2013 2015 being one of the best examples. But estimating turnout by demographic groups is probably harder still.</p> \n  <p>Lying is not considered an issue so much, but people do not always say what they are going to do, or remember correctly how they voted last time (the latter creates an issue for generating representative samples). More important are genuine, last-minute changes of opinion. There was a big movement to Labour in the final stages of 2017, and because polls work back a couple of days, it was not properly picked up.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: How do the results of previous election-period opinion polls from the major agencies compare with what actually happened? It strikes me that the answer to this question, on an agency-by-agency basis, might give a hint towards showing any institutional bias within the pollsters\u2019 organisations. Stephen, retired lecturer, Bexhill</em></p> \n  <p>Pollsters have made a variety of mistakes, although in their defence a movement of one or two percentage points can have a real impact on the final result. </p> \n  <p>In 2017, the Conservative vote share was overestimated and the Labour vote share underestimated by most pollsters, and rolling averages reflected this. Some final polls predicted a Tory lead of 13 points, when in fact the gap to Labour was 2.35 points. The 14-day rolling average predicted an eight-point lead. But Survation, for example, predicted a one-point gap.</p> \n  <p>Is there an anti-Labour bias then? The reverse happened in 2015. Poll trackers had David Cameron\u2019s Conservatives one point ahead going into the election. But the Tories won by 7.5 points in the end. So it is hard to see any long term institutional bias.</p> \n  <p>In my view, it is best to focus on the polls taken in the last three-four days before an election, and ignore 14-day rolling averages \u2013 and look for any evolution in the trend. The late move is the one that counts.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-29T13:51:04.688Z\">at 1.51pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de1196f8f08dcf251b4b78a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/frances-perraudin\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-29T13:16:41.608Z\">1.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Max Wakefield, the director of campaigns at the climate charity Possible \u2013 which kickstarted the campaign for there to be a climate debate \u2013 has described Michael Gove\u2019s appearance at the Channel 4 studios last night as political theatre.</p> \n  <p>Wakefield said he approached the Conservatives a number of times asking them to take part in the debate and that, on the occasions they replied to his emails, the party made it clear they would not take part.

Send them in to us <a href=\"https://guardiannewsandmedia.formstack.com/forms/ask_us_a_question_polling\">here</a>.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: What efforts have been made to improve the polling companies\u2019 methods since the last election and referendum. I\u2019m reminded of conversations around \u201cherding\u201d of pollsters towards the end of each vote. Will Grey, 27, IT professional, Leeds</em></p> \n  <p>Some aspects of polling methodology are uncontroversial \u2013 the companies are good at weighting their samples so they are in line with the demographics of the population. They also tend to ask a standard question, usually: \u201cIn the general election to be held on 12 December, which party will you vote for?\u201d </p> \n  <p>But other factors are hard to control for. Pollsters like to include an accurate sample of how people voted in the last election, except people don\u2019t always remember who that was (this \u201cfalse recall\u201d may have the effect of artificially boosting Labour\u2019s vote, <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/07/17/false-recall-and-how-it-affects-polling\">read more on that here</a>).</p> \n  <p>Pollsters also struggle with predicting turnout via various demographic groups, which has contributed to errors in the past. And finally, some pollsters find ways of making adjustments that reflect little more than \u201cgut feel\u201d. ICM, for example, used to make adjustments to allow for \u201cshy Tories\u201d \u2013 people who intended to vote Conservative but would not say how they had voted. </p> \n  <p>At this election, some companies, such as YouGov, are producing Conservative leads of 13 points. But others, such as ICM, are producing seven-point leads. Why the discrepancy? Their samples are constructed differently. If the figures start to bunch up in the final days, people will rightly ask if herding is going on. </p> \n  <p><em>Q: What is push-polling, and what does the law say about it? How do I identify whether a telephone call I might get is canvassing/push-polling rather than \u201cmarket research\u201d or legitimate polling that is independent of political parties? Mandy, Shropshire</em></p> \n  <p>Push-polling is where people are asked a highly restricted set of questions to produce a desired answer. It is not illegal but it can be highly misleading \u2013 much like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/16/lib-dems-criticised-for-selective-use-of-polling-data-on-leaflets\">a bar chart on a Lib Dem leaflet</a>.

Of course they\u2019re absent from polling results. How significant is this omission? (I do wonder if this was an element in forecasting the 2016 US election). Deborah, Canadian expat, Germany</em></p> \n  <p>I\u2019m not sure this is a big deal to be honest. I would imagine that people who refuse to answer polls or are off the grid are also people who don\u2019t vote in elections. Turnout at the last UK general election was 69% so that leaves 31% who didn\u2019t choose to vote. That\u2019s a lot of people: the total electorate is 45.8m and the non voters, about 14.2m.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Is there any proper evidence that opinion polls influence voting intention, rather than inform? Joe H, doctor, Chelmsford</em></p> \n  <p>Lots. One of the ironies of opinion polls is that political parties use them to successfully persuade people to vote against the anticipated outcome. Look at the last two elections. In 2015, polling was predicting a hung parliament, and David Cameron and Conservative Central Office successfully persuaded the British public to vote against what had been perceived to be a likely outcome: a Labour/SNP coalition. </p> \n  <p>Something similar happened in 2017, when the an important segment of the British public, anticipating a large Conservative majority, chose to support Labour in the last 48 hours of the campaign. The real question is whether something similar will happen this time, given that the polls are showing Boris Johnson will win an overall majority. Polls help create an underlying narrative and often change voter behaviour \u2013 and in my view there\u2019s no problem with that.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de115a58f087410d9875203\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-29T13:00:33.674Z\">1.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This looks good.

What effect do you think these new voters will have? Colin Hynson, self-employed writer and publisher, Norfolk</em></p> \n  <p>There have been 3.85m applications to register since the election was called at the end of October, up 31% on 2017. Those registering are disproportionately young \u2013 2.58m, or 67% of the total \u2013 reflecting the fact that younger people tend to move around more and need to ensure their registration is up to date. In itself, that uplift should benefit Labour somewhat: at the last election, according to Ipsos Mori, 62% of 18-24s voted Labour and 56% of 25-34s. In each case the Conservative share was 27%. But don\u2019t forget that, the Conservatives are far ahead amongst older voters \u2013 61% at the last election. </p> \n  <p><em>Q: If the polls are again mistaken, will the Guardian review its policy of how it covers political polling? Mat, works for a university, Birmingham</em></p> \n  <p>That\u2019s a decision that would be above my pay grade, but we have reviewed our policy on polling in the past. We used to write regular news stories that led on polling, and we no longer do that now. We are well aware that pollsters have had a mixed track record of predicting the final results, but if treated critically there is nevertheless valuable information contained within them, not least because the political parties will be seeing similar data themselves. My task as election psephologist is to look at what the polls are saying and provide some kind of analysis and context; we are cautious about over relying on any one poll and prefer to look at averages and context.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de10dd68f08dcf251b4b6e9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-29T12:45:05.396Z\">12.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Johnson makes pitch to Labour leavers with plans for more state aid and 'buy British' policies after Brexit</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In his opening statement at the press conference Boris Johnson identified some potential benefits of Brexit. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/29/general-election-tories-threaten-channel-4-after-climate-debate-ice-stunt-live-news?page=with:block-5de101ec8f08cd6fe586e18d#block-5de101ec8f08cd6fe586e18d\">11.35am.) </a>The Conservatives have fleshed these out in a press notice issued around the time the press conference was starting, and two of their announcements are significant.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson says the Tories would adopt a more interventionist approach to business after Brexit, taking advantage of the fact the UK would not longer need to comply with EU state aid rules. </strong>The press notice says:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We will back British businesses by introducing a new state aid regime which makes it faster and easier for the government to intervene to protect jobs when an industry is in trouble ...</p> \n   <p>[EU rules] mean that the UK government cannot take steps to quickly and effectively help companies that are in danger.</p> \n   <p>If returned with a majority, a Boris Johnson government will take immediate steps to ensure that a new state aid regime is designed and ready to be in place by 1 January 2021. This will be a whole new approach, based on the World Trade Organisation commitments on restricting harmful subsidies. As the UK will be leaving the EU\u2019s single market, the state aid system that we introduce will be different to the EU\u2019s system.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson says the government would introduce a \u201cbuy British\u201d policy in government procurement after Brexit, taking advantage of the UK no longer having to comply with EU rules.</strong> The press notice says:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We will back British business by fundamentally changing our public procurement policy so it promotes the local economy. This will allow us to make sure that we can boost UK SME [small and medium-sized enterprises] ...</p> \n   <p>Public procurement affects over \u00a3200bn of contracts for work, supplies and services. However, thanks to EU legislation, the rules that these bodies have to follow have become absurdly complex. They impose burdensome and pointless tendering requirements for public contracts, such as having to advertise tenders in the EU\u2019s Official Journal ...</p> \n   <p>If elected with a majority, a Boris Johnson government will take steps to fix this damaging situation. We will, over the course of 2020, replace the EU\u2019s public procurement regulations with new laws which are (i) simpler and cheaper; and (ii) geared towards supporting local business and promoting British business.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>These are both significant announcements. In the past it has normally been Eurosceptics on the left (like Jeremy Corbyn) who have complained about EU regulations because they limit the extent to which government can use subsidies and procurement policies to protect British industries. Conservatives used to gravitate towards the pro-competition arguments, and raise concerns that policies like the ones being announced by Johnson today could end up feather-bedding inefficient industries.</p> \n  <p>Of course, we don\u2019t know the full detail of what is being planned. But potentially this is a big deal. In the press conference the Financial Times\u2019 <strong>Sebastian Payne</strong> suggested this meant the Tories were no longer pursuing a \u201cSingapore Brexit\u201d (ie, a move towards a deregulated, low tax economy), but a \u201cNorth Korea Brexit\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Johnson announced this only a day after it was reported that Labour is revising its campaign to appeal more to leave voters. These are exactly the sort of policies that might appeal to Labour leavers, and so in part this is probably a response to Jeremy Corbyn. But it may also be an indication that Johnson is moving in the direction of blue collar Toryism.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41bda0301622693fdb44d61edca28e8f5d866466\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41bda0301622693fdb44d61edca28e8f5d866466/0_339_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson at his press conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson at his press conference.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-29T13:29:32.931Z\">at 1.29pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de10ffc8f08dcf251b4b703\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/dan-sabbagh\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-29T12:42:37.265Z\">12.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Many of your questions so far have been about how people are selected for opinion polls and whether they should be banned.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Everything. Who is selected? By phone? By landline only? By people willing to answer an unknown caller? By party? By age? By previous responses? Laura, retired</em></p> \n  <p>Polling companies have abandoned phone polling because people no longer pick up the phone to answer questions. Instead they have developed panels of online respondents \u2013 yes, people are paid modestly. When a poll is conducted, pollsters take a sample of 1,000 people (deemed enough to get a reasonably accurate result) from the overall panel. </p> \n  <p>The sample is intended to be statistically representative of the British population, and sometimes, for example, when enough young or old people can\u2019t be found, adjustments are made to ensure the weighting is correct. Selections are made by gender, age, social class and by past voting record. It tries to be an exact science but the question for every polling firm is this: have they recruited the right panel, from which their samples are drawn?</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Do you agree with me that public polls should be banned during election campaigns, as they are in other countries? They seem to be so politicised and are deployed by parties and some companies to sway people\u2019s opinions rather than record those opinions. Michael, Midlands</em></p> \n  <p>Attractive as it might sound, I can\u2019t agree that public polls should be banned during campaigns. What that would mean is that political parties, lobbyists, businesses, hedge funds even could carry out polling, and keep the results to themselves. The public has a right to know. Much better to keep publishing and for people to take an appropriately sceptical view of the results. </p> \n  <p>Some countries do have bans, but they are for a short period \u2013 France, I think, bans them for just the day before an election, although I am unsure what purpose that serves. In Britain, they are banned on election day itself, which does make sense, although even then some hedge funds have in the past conducted their own polls, arguably giving them a head start.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-29T12:49:16.168Z\">at 12.49pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de10faf8f087410d98751cd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/dan-sabbagh\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-29T12:32:17.805Z\">12.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Ask our experts a question</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>I\u2019m Dan Sabbagh, the Guardian\u2019s in-house election psephologist, and will be answering your questions about opinion polling today.

You\u2019ve dismissed quite a chunk of the electorate there haven\u2019t you?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson claimed these comments had been taken out of context. Addressing the caller, he replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I just want to say to you that I mean absolutely no disrespect to you or indeed towards anybody. But these are 25-year-old quotations, culled from articles written before I was even in politics. And which actually when you look at the article itself bears no resemblance to what is claimed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In response, <strong>Angela Rayner</strong>, the shadow education secretary who was a single mother in her teens, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Boris Johnson\u2019s refusal to apologise for his hateful comments about single mothers, their children and working class men is an absolute disgrace.</p> \n   <p>He tried to deny what he wrote, but the evidence is there in black and white for us all to see, proving once again that he\u2019s a liar as well as a sexist.</p> \n   <p>According to Boris Johnson, when I was a young single mum, I should have been pushed into \u2018destitution on a Victorian scale\u2019. Johnson appallingly and hypocritically claims that children of single mums are \u2018ill-raised, ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate\u2019.</p> \n   <p>From attacking single mothers working hard to raise their kids, to advocating sexual harassment in the workplace, Boris Johnson has demonstrated his contempt for women and working class people. Under the Conservatives we stand to lose the rights we have won over decades of struggle. He is not fit to be an MP, let alone prime minister.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-29T12:44:15.021Z\">at 12.44pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de0fb1d8f087410d98750be\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-29T11:04:37.569Z\">11.04am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Sky\u2019s <strong>Rob Powell</strong> has more on Boris Johnson\u2019s throat-cutting gesture during the LBC phone-in.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/robpowellnews/status/1200365066773811200\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">At around 0950 in the interview they return to why he drew his hand across his throat.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has announced plans to extend the use of job-projecting state aid and to implement a \u2018buy British\u2019 policy for government procurement when the UK leaves the EU. He announced both policies, which seemed intended to appeal in particular to Labour-leaning leave voters, in a rare press conference where he appeared alongside his colleagues from the Vote Leave campaign, Michael Gove and Gisela Stuart. In the past it has mostly been Labour Brexiters who have complained about EU state aid rules limiting the ability of the government to use subsidies to help struggling companies, while the Conservatives have been wary of policies that meddle with market economics. But at the news conference Johnson claimed that change was necessary because \u201cthe ramifications of EU state aid rules are felt everywhere\u201d. The Institute of Directors, a free-market business organisation, and the Institute of Economic Affairs, a libertarian thinktank, both strongly criticised the new Tory approach, with the IoD describing this as \u201clike a bad solution in search of the wrong problem\u201d. But the small print of the Conservative announcement suggests that Johnson is planning relatively modest changes to the current regime, rather than a wholesale shift towards 1970s socialism, and it has also been pointed out that any attempt to diverge very far from current EU-style rules would make negotiating a UK-EU free trade deal much harder. At his press conference Johnson also insisted that the Conservatives were the change option at the election, because no other party would take advantages of the opportunities for reform offered by Brexit. There is a full summary of the press conference here. Johnson has praised the police and members of the public who intervened to tackle a terrorist suspect on London Bridge. The man was shot dead by police. My colleague Matthew Weaver is covering the latest developments on a separate live blog. Johnson has refused to disclose how many children he has or whether he is involved in their lives. He was speaking in an LBC phone-in during which he was strongly criticised over past comments about single mothers. Johnson has claimed that the government has several trade deals \u201coven-ready\u201d for when the UK leaves the EU. On the LBC phone-in, he was asked how many trade deals with other countries were in place. The UK is not allowed to formally start trade talks with other countries until after it has left the EU, but it wants to have them ready for when the post-Brexit transition period ends, at the end of 2020 according to current plans. Asked how many trade deals had actually been agreed, Johnson replied: There are a number that are oven-ready ... There are a number that are virtually ready to go. Johnson also repeated his claim that the UK would be able to agree a trade deal with the EU by the end of next year. Sir Ivan Rogers, the former UK ambassador to the EU, is one of many experts who have said Johnson is not being honest about the difficulties he will face. Former Labour MP and chair of the Vote Leave campaign Gisela Stuart has urged longtime Labour voters to \u201cset party allegiance aside to get Brexit done\u201d and support Boris Johnson on 12 December. The BBC has refused to allow Boris Johnson to appear on the Andrew Marr Show this weekend unless he agrees to take part in a one-on-one interview with Andrew Neil, amid ongoing tension between the Conservatives and broadcasters. The BBC is being \u201cplayed\u201d by Boris Johnson and should be angry about his foot-dragging on whether he will agree to an interview with Andrew Neil, Labour\u2019s John McDonnell has said. School leaders and teaching unions have reacted with dismay to the Conservative party\u2019s plans for longer and more disruptive Ofsted inspections, with one warning the changes would \u201cdo more harm than good\u201d if implemented. Stanley Johnson, the prime minister\u2019s father, has been criticised for suggesting most people are not literate enough to spell Pinocchio. He made the comment in a BBC interview where he was defending his son over accusations of lying. That\u2019s all from us for tonight. Because of the London Bridge attack, I\u2019m afraid we won\u2019t be able to keep the blog going to cover the seven-party BBC debate at 7pm tonight. But there will, of course, by news coverage here, on the Guardian\u2019s website. Thanks for the comments. Here is my colleague Marina Hyde\u2019s take on what has happened in the election campaign this week. And here is an extract. And so to the morning after the night before, when a Channel 4 floor manager is still applying Kleenex to the prime ministerial puddle, and hopefully making his refusal to mop up Nigel Farage a union matter. Where are our dramatis personae? On LBC a single mother has read Johnson\u2019s recently unearthed 1995 Spectator column, in which he tips all over single mothers. What a quaint period piece, from a time when all you ever heard about was single mothers, and not the deadbeat dads that left them to it. The single mother\u2019s voice is wobbling while she asks how he can talk about her family like that when he won\u2019t even talk about his own. Presenter Nick Ferrari asks Johnson how many children he has and whether he plays a full and proper role in all their lives. The prime minister twice refuses to answer. Meanwhile, whither Stanley Johnson, the father that public life really needs to be abandoned by? By Friday morning, this desperate ligger had already bagged several media appearances out of his son\u2019s C4 no-show. But I imagine Stanley will now have been spirited to the oubliette in which Jacob Rees-Mogg is being kept, after his appearance on Victoria Derbyshire\u2019s BBC programme. Here, Johnson Snr\u2019s reaction to being told that one viewer had called his son Pinocchio was: \u201cthat requires a degree of literacy which I think the great British public doesn\u2019t necessarily have. They couldn\u2019t spell Pinocchio if they tried.\u201d A line somehow redolent of that deathless Donald Trump quote: \u201cI love the poorly educated.\u201d In his Q&amp;A earlier Boris Johnson said that he was confident of being about to negotiate a trade deal with the EU before the end of next year, particularly because a \u201cstate of grace\u201d applied, with the two sides currently in \u201ccomplete alignment so far as our regulations go\u201d. (See 2.47pm.) Sir Ivan Rogers would not agree. Rogers, who has been one of the fiercest and most perceptive critics of government Brexit policy since he resigned as UK ambassador to the EU in January 2017, addressed this very point in a lecture he gave at Glasgow University on Monday. Here is an excerpt. The further \u201cout\u201d of the European Union we choose to go, and therefore the further we want to go, the longer it will take to negotiate the necessary agreements. This is the first critical point which government ministers either repeatedly continue to get wrong, or choose to mislead the British public about, when talking in these weeks about \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d. The fact of \u201cbeing aligned on day one after exit\u201d does not make the negotiation of a trade deal easier. The current alignment of UK and EU rules \u2013 what PM Johnson now refers to as the \u201cstate of grace\u201d is wholly irrelevant: the only relevant question is where you aim to be on day two, day 200 and day 2000 ... Under [a Norway-type] agreement, you would maintain a lot of your former rights. But that\u2019s because you would submit to a lot of your former obligations. And these obligations are very significant. But if you want much greater divergence from your erstwhile model inside the trade bloc you are exiting, it is precisely because you do not intend to meet those obligations any more. Fair enough. But, by definition, you must then start the negotiation \u201cbottom up\u201d not \u201ctop down\u201d. And the question then becomes, for every sector of the economy, how far, if at all, beyond the baseline of commitments they make into the WTO, are both negotiating parties willing to commit. And, by definition, this will be much more difficult, not less. Because the questions then are how much scope for future divergence does the UK want in each area, and how much latitude the EU is prepared to negotiate. The EU side also has to calibrate the consequential loss of access to its market which the desired UK degree of divergence might cost. Even coming to an unanimous agreement inside the 27 on the right answers will not be short or straightforward. As my colleague Martin Belam reports, Stanley Johnson, the prime minister\u2019s father, told the BBC earlier that he thought most people were not literate enough to spell Pinocchio. He was responding to criticism of his son\u2019s own Pinocchio tendencies. In the comments LostinBruges has asked for examples of the EU state aid rules that Boris Johnson believes prevent the UK government intervening to help a British company. This is what the Conservative party says on this subject in the briefing note to sent out to journalists explaining the new policy. EU state aid law imposes a number of restrictions on the support that the UK can provide to industry. The treaties in principle prohibit \u2018any aid granted by a member state or through state resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings\u2019, which might have an affect on trade between member states (TFEU, art. 107(1). Aids must be approved by the EU institutions to be lawful (TFEU, art. 108). This law is notoriously vague. It means the UK government may have to wait months or years for a decision by the European commission. The state aid rules have a chilling effect on government support for industry. An example of this will suffice: the government decided, in response to the steel crisis four years ago, that it would provide aid to certain firms. On 28 October 2015 it was announced that energy intensive industries \u2018will be exempt from the policy costs of the renewable obligation and feed-in tariffs, to ensure that they have long-term certainty and remain competitive\u2019 (Sajid Javid, Update on UK steel industry: written statement - HCWS410, 17 December 2015). As a result of EU state aid rules, however, the government was prohibited from implementing its policy until approval was given by the European commission. The commission notified the government of its approval on 17 December 2015 (Sajid Javid, Update on UK steel industry: written statement - HCWS410, 17 December 2015). There was therefore a 50 day lag between the government applying for approval and European Commission giving it. According to the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, the EEF, \u2018the [aid] package is worth approximately \u00a345m per annum to the steel sector. In total it is worth approximately \u00a3300m a year to the Energy Intensive sector\u2019 (EEF, 17 December 2015). On this basis, it can be calculated that the 50 day delay as a result of the EU\u2019s state aid rules cost the steel industry \u00a36.2m and energy intensive industries as a whole \u00a341.1m. What is striking about this example is that it suggests Johnson wants a new framework that would give the government a bit more flexibility over state aid - not the opportunity for intervention on a much grander scale than anything allowed now. From my colleague Heather Stewart. My colleague Matthew Weaver is covering the London Bridge incident on a separate live blog. Hugo Dixon from the anti-Brexit website InFacts says Boris Johnson was wrong to claim in his press conference earlier that the UK needs to leave the EU to abolish the tampon tax. (See 11.35am.) The Institute of Directors, the free market business organisation, has issued a very critical statement about the \u201cbuy British\u201d/state aid policies announced by Boris Johnson earlier. (See 12.45pm.) This is from Allie Renison, the IoD\u2019s head of Europe and trade policy. While we need more clarity around the detail, the proposals outlined do not fit easily with ambitions for a \u2018Global Britain\u2019. Indeed they suggest a retreat away from free and open markets, with clear implications for a comprehensive new trade relationship with the EU. This is not the kind of divergence we should be seeking in the first instance. It seems like a bad solution in search of the wrong problem. Even aside from the trading implications of these policies, there are concerns for the very small and medium-sized businesses they claim to be prioritising. Propping up failing enterprises and obliging public bodies to \u2018buy British\u2019 could end up unfairly protecting and subsidising large incumbents at the expense of true competition and new entrants to the market. Locality simply cannot be the main determinant here, as there are rightly multiple criteria to ensure wider value for money. On an icy afternoon in Ruchill, north Glasgow, Labour candidate Pam Duncan-Glancy is explaining the particular travails of canvassing a constituency that is 80% tenements from a wheelchair. She\u2019s aided by a stalwart and well-wrapped team of activists, but also notes how many people are willing to come down their stairs to speak to her in person: the mark of a wider culture change she hopes. One of the stories of the campaign so far for Duncan-Glancy has been undecideds - according to YouGov, 17% of 2017 Labour voters say they are unsure how they\u2019ll vote this time around which is crucial in this key marginal, where the SNP\u2019s Patrick Grady won by a majority of 1,000 two years ago. Undecideds fall into two camps, she says: those who previously voted for the SNP but have concerns about education, the NHS and other services run by the SNP government from Holyrood; and those who are disgusted by the behaviour of the Tories, Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201chumbug\u201d insult, Jacob Rees-Mogg reclining on the Commons benches and so forth. This is the \u201cscunnered\u201d crew, and the challenge is to persuade them to vote at all on 12 December. Here are the main points from the Boris Johnson press conference. Boris Johnson claimed that the government would be able to adopt a new approach to state aid after Brexit without \u201cdistorting competition\u201d. In response to a question about whether his new policy (see 12.45pm) meant he would be running a more interventionist government, he replied: I\u2019m not in favour of distorting competition, I don\u2019t want to see unfair practices introduced, I want to see a level playing field. But when I look sometimes at what EU rules have meant for UK companies, and I saw examples the other day up in Teesside of how fantastic British business was finding it very difficult to develop our potential in wind turbine technology because of EU rules. There will be ways in which we can do things differently and better. Johnson also claimed state aid rules prevented councils or schools from charging for bus services for pupils, or for the disabled. On state aid, the ramifications of EU state aid rules are felt everywhere. I [have] talked to companies, local government or schools that are trying, for instance, to run bus services where they take in some contribution from the passengers. What they find is that they fall foul of state aid rules in so far as they may be deemed, therefore, to be competing with private hire vehicles or private bus companies of one kind or another. So that buses taking kids to school, or helping to move disadvantaged people around the community, are facing real difficulties because of some EU state aid rules. What we will be able to do is be more flexible, be more pragmatic, but also maintain a level playing field. But, when Johnson was asked if he could give an example of a company that had gone bust in the last decade that might have been saved by the sort of policies that Johnson plans to adopt post-Brexit, he declined to give an example. He also dismissed suggestions that this new policy might make it harder for the UK to negotiate a trade deal with the EU next year. (See 11.48am.) He said he was \u201cvery confident\u201d of being able to get a trade deal with the EU before the end of next year. Agreeing the deal before the end of 2020 is essential if Johnson wants to avoid extending the Brexit transition. (The Tory manifesto rules out an extension). Explaining why he was confident, Johnson said: And, the advantage that we have in doing that deal, is that we are in a state of grace with the EU at the moment, in the sense that we have complete alignment so far as our regulations go. We have zero-tariff, zero-quota arrangements already. There has never been a negotiation between trading partners that began with the two sides already in that state of harmony. So I\u2019m full of optimism and confidence. He said he had \u201cno intention\u201d of raising fuel duty in the next parliament. Asked if he would rule out an increase, he said: We don\u2019t want to raise fuel duty. I have absolutely no intention to raise fuel duty. This is not the same as firmly ruling out an increase in fuel duty. He said a vote for the Conservatives was a vote for change. He said: No other party can deliver change at this election because every other party would be stuck in that selfsame hung, broken parliament, arguing amongst themselves about Brexit, which is why the only way to secure change at this election is with the Conservative party. In his speech at the start of the event Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, delivered the same message. He said the vote to leave the EU in 2016 was a vote for change. He said: A vote for any party other than the Conservatives is, in effect, a vote for another hung parliament, a vote for more dither and delay, a vote for a Corbyn-Sturgeon alliance, a vote for two more referendums next year. Put simply, a vote for any party other than the Conservatives is a vote against change. This is important because, in a general election, there are really only three overall narratives you can offer voters - it\u2019s time for a change, more of the same, or don\u2019t let the other lot ruin things - and, all other considerations being equal, the \u2018time for a change\u2019 message is always the strongest. Johnson rejected claims that he was \u201crunning scared\u201d of doing an interview with Andrew Neil - although he refused to say that he confirm that he would agree to participate. Johnson claimed that, when he said in the ITV debate last week that he thought the monarchy was \u201cbeyond reproach\u201d, he was talking about the Queen - not the royal family in general. He said: On the monarchy, the monarchy is the Queen. That in my view, she is beyond reproach. There is a distinction between the monarchy and the royal family and everybody will readily appreciate that. It is an obvious definitional distinction. He dismissed claims that he was someone who told lies. Asked about this, he said: I do not set out to mislead the electorate in my policies, in what I set out to achieve. If you look at my record over the last 10 years when I\u2019ve set out to do something I\u2019ve gone at it with as much energy and determination and work as I can. Gisela Stuart, the former Labour MP who campaigned alongside Johnson and Gove in Vote Leave, said she was urging leave supporters to vote Tory in this election to get Brexit done. She said: In this election I will not vote for Jeremy Corbyn but I can vote for Brexit. This is, after all, the Brexit election. And a vote for Boris Johnson this time around is a vote to get Brexit done. To do so does not make me and would not make you a Tory. Rather, it is the best option for all those who like me still share Labour\u2019s traditional values but who voted to leave and who want certainty and an end to the stagnation, division and delay. She said that Labour\u2019s version of Brexit would effectively amount to remain. (See 11.45am.) Faisal Islam, the BBC\u2019s economics editor, says that if Boris Johnson really does want a tariff-free, quota-free trade deal with the EU before the end of next year, then he may have to abandon the \u201cbuy British\u201d/state aid plans announced today. (See 12.45am.) PD is the political declaration. Our political team will answer more of your questions about the election on Monday at 12.30pm. The Institute of Economic Affairs, a rightwing, free market thinktank, has strongly criticised the Conservative \u201cbuy British\u201d/state aid proposals announced this morning. (See 12.45am.) This is what the IEA\u2019s Victoria Hewson said about state aid. Current state aid rules already stifle our economy, by allowing government interventions \u2013 in special circumstances \u2013 to give support to struggling industry. Extending these rules, by allowing government to use taxpayers\u2019 money to prop up industries that have no future, would be to move swiftly in the wrong direction, crippling the emergence of new and innovative businesses that our economy relies on. Calls to expand state aid translate to veiled support for cronyism. Interventionist and protectionist policies always end up disadvantaging smaller businesses in favour of a few giants. And this is what the IEA\u2019s Julian Jessop said about \u201cbuy British\u201d. A \u2018Buy British\u2019 policy is pure protectionism, and it comes with heavy costs. The Conservatives are showing little understanding of the benefits of free trade, let alone the benefits of Brexit. A \u2018buy British\u2019 policy would make it harder for the public sector to access the best products at the best price, wherever they happen to be made. As a result, consumers or taxpayers will pay more for a lower quality service. Everyone will suffer if there is less choice and less competition. Q: What causes the excessive error in the forecasts of election results? 1. Sampling/computing errors? 2. Methodological errors (wrong assumptions in choosing samples)? 3. People not truly decided until the moment they mark the ballot paper? 4. People saying a plain lie about how they are going to vote? Have the four points above been quantified, in order to compute the correct tolerance error? Or is the tolerance error itself being subject to a wild and unquantifiable error? Anthony, Maidstone Pollsters say their results are right to within three percentage points \u2013 on either side \u2013 95% percent of the time. That means if the Conservatives are polling at 40% then the actual proportion of Tory support will be somewhere between 37% and 43% 19 times out of 20. When you think about it, this leaves a lot of get out. Sampling errors have caused problems in the past when, despite their best efforts, pollsters have not generated a model properly representative of the British population \u2013 2015 being one of the best examples. But estimating turnout by demographic groups is probably harder still. Lying is not considered an issue so much, but people do not always say what they are going to do, or remember correctly how they voted last time (the latter creates an issue for generating representative samples). More important are genuine, last-minute changes of opinion. There was a big movement to Labour in the final stages of 2017, and because polls work back a couple of days, it was not properly picked up. Q: How do the results of previous election-period opinion polls from the major agencies compare with what actually happened? It strikes me that the answer to this question, on an agency-by-agency basis, might give a hint towards showing any institutional bias within the pollsters\u2019 organisations. Stephen, retired lecturer, Bexhill Pollsters have made a variety of mistakes, although in their defence a movement of one or two percentage points can have a real impact on the final result. In 2017, the Conservative vote share was overestimated and the Labour vote share underestimated by most pollsters, and rolling averages reflected this. Some final polls predicted a Tory lead of 13 points, when in fact the gap to Labour was 2.35 points. The 14-day rolling average predicted an eight-point lead. But Survation, for example, predicted a one-point gap. Is there an anti-Labour bias then? The reverse happened in 2015. Poll trackers had David Cameron\u2019s Conservatives one point ahead going into the election. But the Tories won by 7.5 points in the end. So it is hard to see any long term institutional bias. In my view, it is best to focus on the polls taken in the last three-four days before an election, and ignore 14-day rolling averages \u2013 and look for any evolution in the trend. The late move is the one that counts. Max Wakefield, the director of campaigns at the climate charity Possible \u2013 which kickstarted the campaign for there to be a climate debate \u2013 has described Michael Gove\u2019s appearance at the Channel 4 studios last night as political theatre. Wakefield said he approached the Conservatives a number of times asking them to take part in the debate and that, on the occasions they replied to his emails, the party made it clear they would not take part. One Tory response, which Wakefield tweeted, said they would not be attending because they thought environmental issues \u201cshould be in the policy mainstream \u2013 they cut across everything we do and as such should not be cut off in a separate silo\u201d. \u201cIt was a dead cat,\u201d said Wakefield of Gove\u2019s appearance, referring to the political communications strategy of creating a dramatic distraction from a topic that is causing a party damage. [The Conservatives] rang Channel 4 at about 5pm on the day before the debate trying to persuade them to take Gove, so they were obviously recognising that it was causing them some damage [to be seen to be ducking the debate] \u2026 That didn\u2019t work. They clearly decided to pivot to trying to divert as much attention as possible and generate a story, which was a distraction from the narrative at hand. They sought to build a narrative in which they were the victims being taken down by a conspiracy between a leftwing opposition leader and a leftwing broadcaster. It\u2019s depressing enough that they didn\u2019t want to do the debate and so shameful, frankly, that they actually sought to undermine it happening at all. It was political theatre. Just over 15 minutes left to ask any questions you may have on opinion polls. Send them in to us here. Q: What efforts have been made to improve the polling companies\u2019 methods since the last election and referendum. I\u2019m reminded of conversations around \u201cherding\u201d of pollsters towards the end of each vote. Will Grey, 27, IT professional, Leeds Some aspects of polling methodology are uncontroversial \u2013 the companies are good at weighting their samples so they are in line with the demographics of the population. They also tend to ask a standard question, usually: \u201cIn the general election to be held on 12 December, which party will you vote for?\u201d But other factors are hard to control for. Pollsters like to include an accurate sample of how people voted in the last election, except people don\u2019t always remember who that was (this \u201cfalse recall\u201d may have the effect of artificially boosting Labour\u2019s vote, read more on that here). Pollsters also struggle with predicting turnout via various demographic groups, which has contributed to errors in the past. And finally, some pollsters find ways of making adjustments that reflect little more than \u201cgut feel\u201d. ICM, for example, used to make adjustments to allow for \u201cshy Tories\u201d \u2013 people who intended to vote Conservative but would not say how they had voted. At this election, some companies, such as YouGov, are producing Conservative leads of 13 points. But others, such as ICM, are producing seven-point leads. Why the discrepancy? Their samples are constructed differently. If the figures start to bunch up in the final days, people will rightly ask if herding is going on. Q: What is push-polling, and what does the law say about it? How do I identify whether a telephone call I might get is canvassing/push-polling rather than \u201cmarket research\u201d or legitimate polling that is independent of political parties? Mandy, Shropshire Push-polling is where people are asked a highly restricted set of questions to produce a desired answer. It is not illegal but it can be highly misleading \u2013 much like a bar chart on a Lib Dem leaflet. Anybody being approached by some purporting to conduct a poll should ask them which firm they work for, who is paying for the poll, and study the questions keenly to check they are open-ended and not forcing respondents into a simple conclusion. Here is Jonathan Portes, economics professor at Kings College London and a government economist, on the Conservative party\u2019s state aid/procurement announcement. Neil Hanvey, who was sacked as the Scottish National party\u2019s candidate for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath yesterday after admitting posting anti-semitic social media content, has confirmed he is still on the ballot for the election. Hours after posting a statement on Twitter offering an unequivocal apology for his \u201cdreadful errors of judgement\u201d, he posted a statement on his campaign Facebook page late on Thursday night to say he was still standing for election. He said: I can confirm I will still be standing for the Kirkcaldy &amp; Cowdenbeath constituency as a candidate! My policy commitments remain &amp; I am unequivocally dedicated to the constituency and constituents. Please keep a look out for further content over the coming days. Hanvey insisted on Thursday he did not realise the posts were antisemitic or offensive. After saying earlier he fully supported the SNP\u2019s decision to suspend him, he liked Twitter messages calling the SNP\u2019s decision \u201cridiculous\u201d and told one of his followers: \u201cI\u2019m still a candidate Emma, you can still vote for me\u2026 pass it on\u2026\u201d Until his dismissal as the SNP\u2019s candidate, Hanvey was clear favourite to defeat Lesley Laird, the Labour party\u2019s shadow Scottish secretary, who had won back the seat from the SNP in 2017 with a very narrow 259-vote majority. The deadline for nominations was on November 14, so the SNP is unable to field an alternative candidate. Q: My question is about \u2018hidden\u2019 voters: I\u2019d guess that the demographic of \u2018people who refuse to answer polls\u2019 and \u2018people off the grid\u2019 could skew differently than the general population. Of course they\u2019re absent from polling results. How significant is this omission? (I do wonder if this was an element in forecasting the 2016 US election). Deborah, Canadian expat, Germany I\u2019m not sure this is a big deal to be honest. I would imagine that people who refuse to answer polls or are off the grid are also people who don\u2019t vote in elections. Turnout at the last UK general election was 69% so that leaves 31% who didn\u2019t choose to vote. That\u2019s a lot of people: the total electorate is 45.8m and the non voters, about 14.2m. Q: Is there any proper evidence that opinion polls influence voting intention, rather than inform? Joe H, doctor, Chelmsford Lots. One of the ironies of opinion polls is that political parties use them to successfully persuade people to vote against the anticipated outcome. Look at the last two elections. In 2015, polling was predicting a hung parliament, and David Cameron and Conservative Central Office successfully persuaded the British public to vote against what had been perceived to be a likely outcome: a Labour/SNP coalition. Something similar happened in 2017, when the an important segment of the British public, anticipating a large Conservative majority, chose to support Labour in the last 48 hours of the campaign. The real question is whether something similar will happen this time, given that the polls are showing Boris Johnson will win an overall majority. Polls help create an underlying narrative and often change voter behaviour \u2013 and in my view there\u2019s no problem with that. This looks good. My colleague Kate Proctor is hosting the Politics Weekly podcast, and this week she is marking the 100th anniversary of women reporting from Westminster. The episode includes contributions from Rachel Reeves, Harriet Harman, Julia Langdon, Carolyn Quinn and Kate McCann. Some of you have been sending in your questions about opinion polls which I will be answering until 1.30pm. You can share your questions with us via our form here. Q: How can the polls take account of the huge surge of registrations to vote in the past few days? What effect do you think these new voters will have? Colin Hynson, self-employed writer and publisher, Norfolk There have been 3.85m applications to register since the election was called at the end of October, up 31% on 2017. Those registering are disproportionately young \u2013 2.58m, or 67% of the total \u2013 reflecting the fact that younger people tend to move around more and need to ensure their registration is up to date. In itself, that uplift should benefit Labour somewhat: at the last election, according to Ipsos Mori, 62% of 18-24s voted Labour and 56% of 25-34s. In each case the Conservative share was 27%. But don\u2019t forget that, the Conservatives are far ahead amongst older voters \u2013 61% at the last election. Q: If the polls are again mistaken, will the Guardian review its policy of how it covers political polling? Mat, works for a university, Birmingham That\u2019s a decision that would be above my pay grade, but we have reviewed our policy on polling in the past. We used to write regular news stories that led on polling, and we no longer do that now. We are well aware that pollsters have had a mixed track record of predicting the final results, but if treated critically there is nevertheless valuable information contained within them, not least because the political parties will be seeing similar data themselves. My task as election psephologist is to look at what the polls are saying and provide some kind of analysis and context; we are cautious about over relying on any one poll and prefer to look at averages and context. In his opening statement at the press conference Boris Johnson identified some potential benefits of Brexit. (See 11.35am.) The Conservatives have fleshed these out in a press notice issued around the time the press conference was starting, and two of their announcements are significant. Johnson says the Tories would adopt a more interventionist approach to business after Brexit, taking advantage of the fact the UK would not longer need to comply with EU state aid rules. The press notice says: We will back British businesses by introducing a new state aid regime which makes it faster and easier for the government to intervene to protect jobs when an industry is in trouble ... [EU rules] mean that the UK government cannot take steps to quickly and effectively help companies that are in danger. If returned with a majority, a Boris Johnson government will take immediate steps to ensure that a new state aid regime is designed and ready to be in place by 1 January 2021. This will be a whole new approach, based on the World Trade Organisation commitments on restricting harmful subsidies. As the UK will be leaving the EU\u2019s single market, the state aid system that we introduce will be different to the EU\u2019s system. Johnson says the government would introduce a \u201cbuy British\u201d policy in government procurement after Brexit, taking advantage of the UK no longer having to comply with EU rules. The press notice says: We will back British business by fundamentally changing our public procurement policy so it promotes the local economy. This will allow us to make sure that we can boost UK SME [small and medium-sized enterprises] ... Public procurement affects over \u00a3200bn of contracts for work, supplies and services. However, thanks to EU legislation, the rules that these bodies have to follow have become absurdly complex. They impose burdensome and pointless tendering requirements for public contracts, such as having to advertise tenders in the EU\u2019s Official Journal ... If elected with a majority, a Boris Johnson government will take steps to fix this damaging situation. We will, over the course of 2020, replace the EU\u2019s public procurement regulations with new laws which are (i) simpler and cheaper; and (ii) geared towards supporting local business and promoting British business. These are both significant announcements. In the past it has normally been Eurosceptics on the left (like Jeremy Corbyn) who have complained about EU regulations because they limit the extent to which government can use subsidies and procurement policies to protect British industries. Conservatives used to gravitate towards the pro-competition arguments, and raise concerns that policies like the ones being announced by Johnson today could end up feather-bedding inefficient industries. Of course, we don\u2019t know the full detail of what is being planned. But potentially this is a big deal. In the press conference the Financial Times\u2019 Sebastian Payne suggested this meant the Tories were no longer pursuing a \u201cSingapore Brexit\u201d (ie, a move towards a deregulated, low tax economy), but a \u201cNorth Korea Brexit\u201d. Johnson announced this only a day after it was reported that Labour is revising its campaign to appeal more to leave voters. These are exactly the sort of policies that might appeal to Labour leavers, and so in part this is probably a response to Jeremy Corbyn. But it may also be an indication that Johnson is moving in the direction of blue collar Toryism. Many of your questions so far have been about how people are selected for opinion polls and whether they should be banned. Q: Everything. Who is selected? By phone? By landline only? By people willing to answer an unknown caller? By party? By age? By previous responses? Laura, retired Polling companies have abandoned phone polling because people no longer pick up the phone to answer questions. Instead they have developed panels of online respondents \u2013 yes, people are paid modestly. When a poll is conducted, pollsters take a sample of 1,000 people (deemed enough to get a reasonably accurate result) from the overall panel. The sample is intended to be statistically representative of the British population, and sometimes, for example, when enough young or old people can\u2019t be found, adjustments are made to ensure the weighting is correct. Selections are made by gender, age, social class and by past voting record. It tries to be an exact science but the question for every polling firm is this: have they recruited the right panel, from which their samples are drawn? Q: Do you agree with me that public polls should be banned during election campaigns, as they are in other countries? They seem to be so politicised and are deployed by parties and some companies to sway people\u2019s opinions rather than record those opinions. Michael, Midlands Attractive as it might sound, I can\u2019t agree that public polls should be banned during campaigns. What that would mean is that political parties, lobbyists, businesses, hedge funds even could carry out polling, and keep the results to themselves. The public has a right to know. Much better to keep publishing and for people to take an appropriately sceptical view of the results. Some countries do have bans, but they are for a short period \u2013 France, I think, bans them for just the day before an election, although I am unsure what purpose that serves. In Britain, they are banned on election day itself, which does make sense, although even then some hedge funds have in the past conducted their own polls, arguably giving them a head start. I\u2019m Dan Sabbagh, the Guardian\u2019s in-house election psephologist, and will be answering your questions about opinion polling today. Election psephologist is not my full-time job however, I am also the defence and security editor. I have plenty of experience of political journalism, having previously worked as a lobby reporter during the Theresa May phase of the Brexit crisis. Prior to that I was home editor, helping run the Guardian\u2019s domestic coverage, including its political team, from the news desk, over two other elections and two referendums. If you have a question you can send it to us by filling in the form here. Michael Gove winds up. He says Johnson has been on the platform for 45 minutes. He claims that Johnson has taken more questions at this news conference than any other politician during the campaign. (It may be true that Johnson answered more questions at this event than Jeremy Corbyn has answered at a single event. But during the campaign as a whole Corbyn has been better at submitting himself to questioning from journalists. He has almost certainly held more events that have involved Q&amp;As with the media.) The event is now over. I will post a summary soon. Q: What is your approach to screening cooperation with China? Johnson says there is a balance to be struck between being open to trade, and not doing anything that might compromise national security. I\u2019m very, very far from a Sinophobe. Q: Will fuel duty go up under the Tories? Johnson says he has \u201cno intention\u201d of raising fuel duty. He says Labour would introduce huge tax rises. Q: Will you meet Donald Trump next week? Johnson says he will be hosting the Nato meeting next week, and looks forward to meeting all Nato leaders. Q: Last night you said you had not lied in your political career. But didn\u2019t you lie to Michael Howard about having an affair? Johnson says he does not set out to mislead people. When he sets out to do something, he delivers. That is why he is so upset about the failure to deliver Brexit. Q: Do you still think the institution of the monarchy is beyond reproach? Johnson says, in his view, the monarchy is the Queen. He implies that is what he was talking about when he said the monarchy was beyond reproach in the ITV debate. He says that is not the same as talking about the royal family. Q: Why won\u2019t you give MPs the chance to repeal the foxhunting ban? Johnson says he does not want to bring back foxhunting. He wants to champion animal rights. He thinks it is wrong that people aren\u2019t able to ban shark fin soup. That should be banned. You cannot do it under EU law. And you cannot ban the shipment of live animals either under EU law. What is Labour\u2019s policy on this, he asks. Q: Can you give an example of a business over the last decade that you would have saved with state aid? Johnson says he does not want to address this. It would not be fair on individual companies, Michael Gove claims. Q: Is it all over for Jacob Rees-Mogg in your government? Johnson says any commentary on this would be seen as his \u201cmeasuring up the curtains\u201d before an election victory. Q: You say you are confident of being able to get a deal. Will you end no-deal planning? Johnson says no-deal planning was thoroughly useful. It convinced the EU the UK was serious about leaving. He says these plans should be kept in a state of readiness. They will remain \u201cextant\u201d, he says. Q: You said when you became PM you would fix the crisis in social care. Now you are saying you want to discuss the problem with Labour. Isn\u2019t that political cowardice? Johnson says this is a \u201chuge national crisis\u201d. The government is putting more into the NHS, he says. But it is the interface between people leaving hospital and needing social care that creates the problem. The government will put an extra \u00a31bn every year into the system to address this. He says he is reaching out to Labour. Q: Do your state aid plans imply a North Korea Brexit? Johnson says he believes in competition. But there are distortions sometimes introduced by the EU rules. Outside the EU, the government may be able to speed things up in relation to planning processes. And with school buses, or buses for the disabled, there may be advantages from being outside the EU. Q: Have your views on single mothers changed since 1995? Johnson says he has addressed this. Q: Will the new state aid rules be devolved? Johnson says policy in this area will remain national policy. Q: The EU won\u2019t give you a zero tariff, zero quota trade deal if you want to diverge from EU rules. Why do you think you will get a deal? Johnsons says that under trade deals you have committees to arbitrate when there are disputes. But it should be a committee of equals. Q: Do you favour bringing back more children born to Isis suspects to the UK? Johnson says these cases pose difficult questions. The government is doing what it can. Q: You have blamed everyone for the failure to deliver Brexit. Are any of you willing to take responsiblity for the fact that you started this project without a plan? Johnson says this is a great project. It is a tragedy that parliament has blocked it. Gisela Stuart says the alternatives offered to Brexit, including Labour\u2019s alternative, is just a version of remain. Labour\u2019s proposed Brexit is just a version of remain, claims Gisela Stuart. Michael Gove says he takes full responsibility for his actions. But so should the MPs \u2013 Labour and Conservative \u2013 who said they would honour the referendum result, and then blocked it. Q: If you fail to get a trade deal by the end of 2020, will the UK end the transition period and leave without a deal? In the past you have made derogatory comments about single mothers. Why should they vote for you? Johnson says he has written millions of words. People can cull them and distort them. He says Brexit will allow the UK to cut VAT on tampons. And the government will be able to do other things too, like introduce free ports. He asks how Britain would benefit from the Brexit deal Labour is planning. The UK would not be able to take back control, he says. He says he has a great deal. Coming back to his plans, he says the UK will be able to begin negotiating trade deals as soon as the UK leaves the EU. Johnson and his colleagues are now taking questions. Q: Will you take responsibility for any damage to the economy from a no-deal Brexit? Would you run a more interventionist government? And are you running scared of the Andrew Neil interview? Johnson says he is here, submitting himself to questions. He says John Pienaar, who asked the question, is a formidable interviewer. He says he is confident he will be able to negotiate a trade deal with the EU by the end of next year. The UK is \u201cin a state of grace\u201d because it is already aligned to EU rules. That will make it easier, he suggests. He says a trade deal has never started from this point. On state aid, he says the ramifications are felt everywhere. He says councils that try to run bus services for pupils, and then try to charge, fall foul of state aid rules because they are deemed to be in competition with other providers. Johnson is now speaking about the benefits from Brexit. The UK will be able to: Buy British, in government procurement Abolish the tampon tax Intervene to protect British businesses Introduce an Australian-style points-based immigration system (This may be the first time that being able to abolish the tampon tax has been cited as the second most prominent benefit from Brexit.) Boris Johnson is speaking now. He says this election is an opportunity to get Brexit done. Then the government can unleash the UK\u2019s potential. He says, if he gets a majority government, he will bring the withdrawal agreement bill back before Christmas. (Presumably that means getting MPs to give it a second reading before Christmas.) And Johnson says the UK will be able to leave the EU by 31 January, \u201cno ifs, not buts\u201d. Gisela Stuart says she supported Tony Blair\u2019s Labour because it represented a fairer society. Her values have not changed, she says. But the Labour party has changed. The Labour party of John Smith, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown has gone. She says the country can choose change \u2013 but not by voting for Jeremy Corbyn. In this election, she will not vote for Corbyn. But she can vote for Brexit. A vote for Boris Johnson this time is a vote to get Brexit done. She says this does not mean she is a Tory, or that she will vote for Johnson in future elections. She urges other leave voters to do the same. Gove says a vote for any party other than the Conservative party is a vote against change. Boris Johnson is holding a rare press conference. He is appearing with two of his colleagues from the Vote Leave campaign - Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, and Gisela Stuart, the former Labour MP. There is a live feed at the top of the blog. Michael Gove starts. He says the vote to leave the EU in 2016 was a vote for change. In his LBC phone-in Boris Johnson was asked by a caller, a single mother, why he made disparaging comments about single mothers in a Spectator column in the 1990s when he was not willing to discuss his own family circumstances. For the benefit of listeners, the present, Nick Ferrari, elaborated on what Johnson had written. Ferrari said: Let me just share, these are comments that go back to the mid-90s, they\u2019re featured in today\u2019s Daily Mirror, I have to read them: On working class men you said: \u2018They\u2019re likely to be drunk, criminal, aimless, feckless, and hopeless and perhaps claiming to suffer from low self-esteem brought on by unemployment.\u2019 On single mothers, \u2018they\u2019re uppity\u2019 \u2013 which is a word with its own issues \u2013 and \u2018irresponsible\u2019, and on their children, they\u2019re \u2018ill-raised, ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate\u2019. You\u2019ve dismissed quite a chunk of the electorate there haven\u2019t you? Johnson claimed these comments had been taken out of context. Addressing the caller, he replied: I just want to say to you that I mean absolutely no disrespect to you or indeed towards anybody. But these are 25-year-old quotations, culled from articles written before I was even in politics. And which actually when you look at the article itself bears no resemblance to what is claimed. In response, Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary who was a single mother in her teens, said: Boris Johnson\u2019s refusal to apologise for his hateful comments about single mothers, their children and working class men is an absolute disgrace. He tried to deny what he wrote, but the evidence is there in black and white for us all to see, proving once again that he\u2019s a liar as well as a sexist. According to Boris Johnson, when I was a young single mum, I should have been pushed into \u2018destitution on a Victorian scale\u2019. Johnson appallingly and hypocritically claims that children of single mums are \u2018ill-raised, ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate\u2019. From attacking single mothers working hard to raise their kids, to advocating sexual harassment in the workplace, Boris Johnson has demonstrated his contempt for women and working class people. Under the Conservatives we stand to lose the rights we have won over decades of struggle. He is not fit to be an MP, let alone prime minister. Sky\u2019s Rob Powell has more on Boris Johnson\u2019s throat-cutting gesture during the LBC phone-in. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Jedidajah Otte. Here is some reaction to the Boris Johnson LBC phone-in from political journalists and commentators. The Scottish National party leader, Nicola Sturgeon, is on BBC Woman\u2019s Hour. If she had the option of supporting a Jeremy Corbyn-led government, would she support it? Her party is not in favour of a formal coalition, she says, but she could never allow herself to do anything that could aide Boris Johnson, hinting that she might consider propping up Labour, if that kept Johnson out of power. She \u201cdeplores\u201d Corbyn\u2019s lack of leadership in regard to antisemitism, Sturgeon says. If you are concerned about Corbyn, wouldn\u2019t progressive SNP MP\u2019s be the better option? Sturgeon asks. What does she say to the nearly 40% of Scottish leave voters? These voters were probably frustrated by austerity, and she would tell them that these issues needed to be addressed. He would give Corbyn a calculator for Christmas, so he can realise the extent of the debts he would be racking up with his plans, Johnson says. Asked about a recent claim Johnson made about being \u201cmade of Greggs\u201d, Ferrari asks the PM how much a sausage roll costs. \u201cI give up,\u201d Johnson says. \u201c\u00a31.90?\u201d he guesses eventually. He has also eaten vegan sausage rolls, Johnson says. And that\u2019s it. Asked about the nationwide cladding crisis resulting from the Grenfell distaster, Johnson says the government was working \u201cas fast as they can\u201d on making buildings safe, and that he\u2019s planning to look at the issue from \u201ctop to bottom\u201d. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Ferrari intervenes. He never liked this type of cladding, the PM says, but fails to give an answer containing any figures, research or detailed approaches the government might be considering. Should Corbyn apologise for antisemitism in his party? Johnson says he thinks it\u2019s \u201cincredible\u201d that Labour had \u201cmoved so far to the left\u201d and \u201csticks up for Hamas, or Tehran, Putin\u201d. He is deeply sorry for the offence caused by his remarks about Muslim women. Is he sorry about using those words [eg letterboxes] or the offence caused? Ferrari asks. Johnson answers a different question for the umpteenth time. \u201cSo you stand by these words,\u201d Ferrari states. How come Johnson is prepared to comment on other people\u2019s children if he isn\u2019t prepared to talk about his own? Ferrari asks. \u201cHow many children do you have? Are you fully and wholly involved in all their lives?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think this is what the nation wants to hear,\u201d Johnson says, after a lengthy attempt to deflect. Is there another Johnson on the way? he is asked. The PM struggles again, stammers a few lines about getting Brexit done. The PM pledges that his government would not raise any income tax, VAT and national insurance contributions, and will cut business rates in the first budget. The caller says her children suffered stigma caused by comments made by Boris Johnson about single mothers at the time. A caller says she is a single mother and doesn\u2019t appreciate comments about single mothers he made in a Spectator column in 1995. These are 25-year-old quotations from \u201cbefore I was even in politics\u201d, Johnson says, and just another attempt by the Labour party to distract from the reality that they have no Brexit plan. He means no disrespect to anyone, he says. The quotations are \u201cabsolute distortions of what I said,\u201d Johnson adds, then promptly switches to bashing the Labour party. Why should I vote for you if you can\u2019t even debate the climate change? a caller asks. \u201cI can\u2019t do absolutely every debate,\u201d Johnson says. This government is committed to getting carbon-free by 2050, he says. What about his response to the flooding, Ferrari asks? His government is \u201cabsolutely second-to-none in Europe\u201d on issues relating to the tackling of climate change, the PM says. He has \u201cabsolute sympathy\u201d for the flooding victims, he adds. Ferrari accuses him of missing all sorts of important meetings. Johnson declines to answer. \u201cWe want to be a world leader in climate change,\u201d he says. Johnson promises new apprenticeships to help young offenders with their rehabilitation. Ferrari asks what companies these apprenticeships would be with. Johnson names one, but seemingly doesn\u2019t know the names of any others. The police have to be given the authority for stop and search in order for people to be deterred from carrying knives, he says. Where is Jacob Rees-Mogg? Ferrari asks. What did the PM say to him after he made widely criticised derogatory comments about the victims of the Grenfell tragedy? The PM doesn\u2019t answer and digresses again, but is eventually cornered. \u201cI\u2019m not going to go into my conversations with colleagues,\u201d the PM says, clearly thrown by Ferrari\u2019s insistence that he answer this question. The next caller asks Johnson about his plans for social care. We\u2019re putting \u00a31.5bn in, and another billion every year for the next five years. Johnson is pressed about a statement he made a few weeks back, in which he expressed that he doesn\u2019t think anybody should have to sell their home to get social care. How will it then be funded? Ferrari asks. Johnson grumbles and mumbles for a bit. \u201cYou don\u2019t know, do you? [\u2026] You don\u2019t have a clue!\u201d Ferrari says. \u201cI don\u2019t have this figure now, no,\u201d Johnson says. Ferrari quizzes the PM on misleading pledges about building \u201cnew\u201d hospitals, when really some of them will only be rebuilt. Johnson says that he feels a rebuilt hospital is a new one. The nurse who called in says the PM\u2019s comments have \u201cdone nothing\u201d to convince her that she should keep going to work. Johnson sighs. Johnson asks callers to compare the \u201c635 Tory MPs determined to get Brexit done\u201d with a Labour shadow cabinet in which virtually every MP except Corbyn is opposed to Brexit. The next caller is a Waspi woman and a qualified nurse of 34 years. How can the PM convince her that he\u2019ll deliver tens of thousands of new nurses as promised? The PM says he doesn\u2019t know about Corbyn\u2019s \u00a358bn pledged for paying off Waspi women. Why did he misrepresent the 50,000 new nurses figure? Ferrari asks. He says there are 19,000 nurses now who want to leave. There are a further 31,000 that we wish to recruit.\u201d He has to admit only 31,000 of the 50,000 pledged ones will be new. If you had one option only, would you rather be PM or leave the EU? the PM is asked. He\u2019d get out of the EU, Johnson says, after a brief moment of hesitation. January 31st is still the exit deadline, and Britain will \u201cdefinitely\u201d be out by then, he says. When asked how many trade deals the government had on the table so far, the PM first says he doesn\u2019t know, then says \u201cI imagine around a dozen\u201d. He is asked to name about four. He says India, Australia, New Zealand and China are all possibilities, and is derided by presenter Ferrari for \u201cwhispering\u201d into the microphone. The PM is now live on LBC. Jeremy Corbyn and Jo Swinson will be joining the programme at a later stage over the next two weeks. The first Q by presenter Nick Ferrari is about the NHS. Is it for sale? Johnson is asked whether he can be trusted, given that he has lost his job before for lying. Johnson says there is \u201cno evidence\u201d that the UK government wants to sell the NHS. The PM switches to talking about Jeremy Corbyn and his \u201cpointless and divisive\u201d referendum next year, as well as Labour\u2019s \u201ccatastrophic\u201d neutral position on Brexit. When pressed, Johnson says people \u201cshould\u201d trust him. The reason trust was being eroded was that 17.4m people had voted to Leave and had been let down so far, he added. Boris Johnson will be taking questions of callers on LBC Radio shortly. The education secretary Gavin Williamson told the Today show that the Conservatives would put an extra \u00a310m into Ofsted, the education watchdog, to strengthen the quality of inspection. When asked whether he regretted that a Conservative government previously had cut Ofsted\u2019s funding significantly, by 52% in real terms between 2000 and 2017, Williamson said he didn\u2019t believe this had been a mistake, and that the Tories had simply been \u201cdealing with an economic crisis the last Labour government had created\u201d. Asked whether the Tories were \u201cthreatening\u201d Channel 4, Williamson said that was not the case, and that his party was simply raising a \u201cperfectly legitimate\u201d complaint. He said that whoever would form the next government would review Channel 4\u2019s public licence in 2024, and denied that the Conservatives had issued a licence review threat in retaliation. \u201cThe government has no plans [...] in terms of changing what Channel 4 does,\u201d Williamson said, but added that the broadcaster\u2019s ice sculpture stunt was \u201ca gimmick\u201d and \u201ca shame\u201d. Labour just tweeted a list of 60 questions that should be answered by Boris Johnson during his press conference this morning, the party argues. Questions range from \u2018Do you still think that the way to deal with advice from a female colleague is to \u201cjust pat her on the bottom and send her on her way\u201d?\u2019 to \u2018Do you still call gay people \u201ctank-topped bumboys\u201d?\u2019. Stanley Johnson, the PM\u2019s father, said he exchanged messages with his son last night, and that substituting him with Michael Gove would have led to an interesting discussion about an urgent matter. \u201cAre you saying that Michael Gove is not a leader?\u201d Stanley Johnson told BBC Breakfast. \u201cWhy play schoolboy games with ice sculptures?\u201d He said he wasn\u2019t \u201cprivy\u201d to where the PM had been last night, and stated that the melting ice sculpture row sadly overshadowed a \u201cmajorly important debate\u201d. \u201cMr Gove was a very valid substitute,\u201d he said, adding that any PM might have more important things to do, and that Gove was \u201cprobably the best environment secretary this country has ever had\u201d. The Conservatives\u2019 formal complaint to Channel 4 claims the Tories were \u201cdeprived of representation\u201d when the channel refused to let Michael Gove fill in for the PM. The broadcaster had decided to put up ice sculptures in place of Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage, who both failed to turn up for last night\u2019s climate debate between party leaders. Gavin Williamson, the education minister, told BBC Breakfast the broadcaster had \u201cslammed the door\u201d in Michael Gove\u2019s face, and accused Channel 4 of bias. McDonnell said he was \u201cso annoyed\u201d about Boris Johnson not appearing on the BBC to be grilled by Andrew Neil, and that the BBC should be annoyed, too. \u201cAll political parties understood that there would be sequence of interviews with each leader,\u201d McDonnell told the Today show. \u201cI think this is a matter of honour.\u201d The PM was \u201cplaying the BBC\u201d, pushing an appearance until the deadline for postal votes had passed, thinking \u201chis Bullingdon Club friends\u201d were above public scrutiny, and was running scared of interviewer Neil, who would \u201ctake him apart\u201d, McDonnell said. McDonnell denied that the party had made a change in strategy. Labour\u2019s \u201cBrexit strategy\u2019, he said, was negotiating a \u201csensible and credible\u201d deal, while also ensuring that \u201cpeople have the option of remain\u201d, within six months there would be a referendum. He said the party\u2019s pitch to leave voters would be to give people hope. \u201cIf you think things are alright at the moment, you vote for the Conservatives,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think people do think things are alright at the moment.\u201d Hi there, I\u2019m taking over from my colleague Kate Lyons now. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today show this morning, talking about Labour\u2019s regional manifestos, which are being launched today. Number one priority in Labour\u2019s efforts to regenerate the local economy across the country and tackle regional inequality, McDonnell said, was tackling climate change. Alternative energy sources would have to be pushed and dependency on fossil fuel phased out, he said, promising \u201cmassive investments in on- and off-shore wind\u201d, \u201c9000 turbines, 100 000 jobs\u201d, and huge investments in electric cars, which would lead to 32.000 new jobs. 20.000 jobs would be created via investments in solar power, McDonnell said. Overall Labour would be investing \u00a3250bn over ten years. Asked what he would tell critics doubting the credibility of these plans, McDonnell said the IFS \u201cattacked us for being too ambitious.\u201d \u201cYes, we can,\u201d McDonnell said. The day ahead On the Labour side of things, Jeremy Corbyn is currently not scheduled to make any appearances on Friday but the shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, will be in the east Midlands as the party launches its regional manifestos targeting local issues. The Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, will be in Livingston to discuss the party\u2019s package for young people. Boris Johnson is expected to hold a press conference in London on Friday morning. Expect ice jokes. Johnson has also declined an invitation to a leaders debate tonight in Cardiff, as have Corbyn and Farage. But leaders of the Lib Dems, SNP, Green and Plaid parties will attend a BBC seven-way debate alongside representatives of the Conservatives, Labour and the Brexit party. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, will be in south Wales to discuss safety issues with senior members of the Muslim and Jewish communities and will then attend the BBC debate. The Scottish Liberal Democrats are launching their manifesto in Edinburgh. The Guardian can also reveal 11 wealthy American donors who have given a total of more than $3.7m (\u00a32.9m) to rightwing UK groups in the past five years, raising questions about the influence of foreign funding on British politics. The groups are here. In the wake of the Brexit vote, some of the ultra free-market thinktanks, which have received funding from the groups, have gained exceptional access to the heart of Boris Johnson\u2019s government, as the investigations team unpacks in today\u2019s long read. Our north of England editor, Helen Pidd, has been to Morecambe to pen the latest of out constituency profiles. The seat of Morecambe and Lunesdale is natural Labour territory yet it has a Tory MP, David Morris, and Helen found that many Labour-leaning voters were not convinced about Jeremy Corbyn. \u201cHe does come across as a man of integrity and honesty, but not strength,\u201d says Tracy Kohl, who runs a help centre for the many people in the area struggling with the impact of nine years of austerity. Good morning and welcome to the election live blog. The first action of the day is likely to involve the fallout from last night\u2019s leaders\u2019 climate debate on Channel 4 in which the producers inserted a melting ice sculpture in place of Boris Johnson when the Tory leader pulled out of the programme. Channel 4 refused to allow Michael Gove to substitute for Johnson, prompting the Conservative party to suggest that it could review the channel\u2019s remit if it retains power on 12 December. As for the debate itself, leaders of the other parties vied to prove their crisis-fighting credentials. Our environment correspondent, Fiona Harvey, writes today that the biggest loser was Johnson for failing to turn up, but also noted that Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson appeared to be outflanked by Jeremy Corbyn on what what was once one of her party\u2019s strongest suits. Also today, children across the UK are striking from school for climate action. The other main stories this morning are: Tory candidates have been given a detailed dossier on how to attack Labour and Liberal Democrat rivals, which contains numerous rehashed and potentially misleading claims. The BBC is demanding the Conservatives take down Facebook adverts featuring footage of its journalists Laura Kuenssberg and Huw Edwards. The Conservatives have pledged to boost Ofsted\u2019s power to inspect schools Sikhs in the Conservative party have been critical after the leadership failed to take action against former minister Philip Dunne after he told a rival at a hustings that he was \u201ctalking through his turban\u201d. And Gary Younge writes today about how, given Britain\u2019s history, it\u2019s no surprise that racism still infects our politics",

Here, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/29/pinocchio-row-stanley-johnson-suggests-uk-public-is-illiterate\" title=\"\">Johnson Snr\u2019s reaction</a> to being told that one viewer had called his son Pinocchio was: \u201cthat requires a degree of literacy which I think the great British public doesn\u2019t necessarily have.

Or, as a friend calls them, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jul/22/iraq\" title=\"\">Uday</a> and Schmuday. Stanley Johnson is the arguably the most talentless political relative of all, miles outstripping fabled duds like Billy Carter or Terry Major-Ball or Cherie Blair\u2019s sister Lauren Booth, and making Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s climate-denialist brother Piers look like someone you would prefer to have a pint with. Possibly. The pushiest of all parents, living through the child he helped to damage \u2013 just think of Stanley Johnson as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/27/joe-jackson-one-of-the-most-monstrous-fathers-in-pop\" title=\"\">Joe Jackson</a> of British politics.</p> <p>Friday morning brought a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/29/general-election-tories-threaten-channel-4-after-climate-debate-ice-stunt-live-news?page=with:block-5de11d9d8f08cd6fe586e317#block-5de11d9d8f08cd6fe586e317\" title=\"\">press conference</a> featuring Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, which unfortunately turned out not to concern the imminent arrival of an asteroid.

Like a pair of absolute journalists, at least one of whom had already tucked away a couple of bottles of ros\u00e9, but who\u2019d both just got a massive legal on a story they\u2019d thought would fly under the radar. Three years on, things have only got worse. Can\u2019t believe that letting newspaper journalists run the country has come to this.

What will the next 12 days bring, other than things we might place in the file marked \u201cMUCH WORSE\u201d? It\u2019s difficult to be sure about anything, other than the realisation that there are highly unstable radioactive isotopes deteriorating less quickly than our standards of public debate.</p> <p>\u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian journalist</p>",

Here, Johnson Snr\u2019s reaction to being told that one viewer had called his son Pinocchio was: \u201cthat requires a degree of literacy which I think the great British public doesn\u2019t necessarily have. They couldn\u2019t spell Pinocchio if they tried.\u201d A line somehow redolent of that deathless Donald Trump quote: \u201cI love the poorly educated.\u201d This triumph of a media round started with Stanley opting to be in the Channel 4 spin room, despite his son wimping out. Having your dad in the spin room is the most embarrassing thing I\u2019ve seen since what feels like forever, which is the new way of saying \u201cyesterday\u201d. It is even worse than Donald Trump\u2019s regular deployment of his large adult sons, Don Jr and Eric. Or, as a friend calls them, Uday and Schmuday. Stanley Johnson is the arguably the most talentless political relative of all, miles outstripping fabled duds like Billy Carter or Terry Major-Ball or Cherie Blair\u2019s sister Lauren Booth, and making Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s climate-denialist brother Piers look like someone you would prefer to have a pint with. Possibly. The pushiest of all parents, living through the child he helped to damage \u2013 just think of Stanley Johnson as the Joe Jackson of British politics. Friday morning brought a press conference featuring Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, which unfortunately turned out not to concern the imminent arrival of an asteroid. I can\u2019t think of anyone who could motivate the living to embrace the kindness of death more gladly than these two, whose images should be plastered over the walls of abattoirs. Instead, Johnson and Gove \u2013 enabled by former Labour MP Gisela Stuart \u2013 lied about getting Brexit done in days, with the advance briefing floating the theme as \u201cRemember how you felt that morning?\u201d (a reference to 24 June 2016). I certainly remember how Gove and Johnson looked that morning. Like a pair of absolute journalists, at least one of whom had already tucked away a couple of bottles of ros\u00e9, but who\u2019d both just got a massive legal on a story they\u2019d thought would fly under the radar. Three years on, things have only got worse. Can\u2019t believe that letting newspaper journalists run the country has come to this. If only the state of the newspaper industry had offered some clue as to how it would play out. Indeed, somewhat ironicidally, Michael Gove seems to be pivoting to video. The actual cabinet minister turned up to Channel 4 with his own three-person crew to film what he lied was his \u201cno-platforming\u201d \u2013 a reminder that Gove\u2019s frequently waved reusable coffee cup is no offset against his vast output of toxic emissions. The chilling thing is that even a month ago, this stunt would have felt far-fetched. What will the next 12 days bring, other than things we might place in the file marked \u201cMUCH WORSE\u201d? It\u2019s difficult to be sure about anything, other than the realisation that there are highly unstable radioactive isotopes deteriorating less quickly than our standards of public debate. \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian journalist",

Growing up in the north in the late 40s and 50s our weekly menu was an \u201cunmovable feast\u201d. Sunday roast provided gravy for meatless panackelty Monday or minced leftover meat for a pie. The week progressed through mince and tatties, mince on toast, shepherd\u2019s pie, and once in a blue moon a mutton chop. Friday was putting the knife into my brother\u2019s money box for pennies for a tin of beans until my father\u2019s pay came. Jean Jackson Seer Green, Buckinghamshire \u2022 To \u201cmake [Boris] Johnson the shortest-serving PM ever\u201d may well be an inspiring idea (Editorial, 27 November), but that objective has already been missed, as he surpassed George Canning\u2019s length of tenure last week. He might just, however, manage to get into second place, as he will not pass Lord Goderich (as it happens, Canning\u2019s successor in office) until the weekend after the general election.

It was so terrible, this tweet, that when I read it, it had a physical effect on me.</p> \n<p>In a moment, I will try to describe this physical effect; but first, I am sorry to say, I must tell you what the tweet was. It was a response to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/angelarayner/status/1199299924145426433\" title=\"\">another tweet</a> by Labour\u2019s Angela Rayner, who was defending the rapper Stormzy against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2019/nov/26/twitter-blackface-why-michael-goves-stormzy-comments-are-so-egregious\" title=\"\">Gove\u2019s mockery</a> of his vocal support for Labour.

It was a disgraceful attempt to ridicule not only a prominent young black entertainer for his political engagement, but the language of an entire community. It was very bad, the tweet.

A source told the Guardian the prime minister\u2019s sister, the broadcaster and pro-remain campaigner Rachel Johnson, is lined up to appear as a guest on the programme. The row over the prime minister\u2019s public appearances follows his boycott of Channel 4 News\u2019 climate change debate on Thursday in which he was replaced with a melting ice sculpture. In response the Conservatives formally complained to media regulator Ofcom about alleged bias, threatened to change the public service remit of Channel 4 if they won the election, and sent their own camera crew to follow Michael Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, as he attempted to take Johnson\u2019s place on the debate.

This is what we\u2019ve come to: Boris Johnson eating a mediocre baked good is somehow a sort of galactic-brained version of everyman campaigning, a highpoint of election conversation, and a stunning and remarkable example of strategic nous. When really, it looks like grainy VHS footage of a toddler eating a cracker for the first time re-enacted by a man who, on every other version of Earth, is the village weirdo famed for acting erratically near urinals, and not, as we have it here on Earth-Prime, the most politically important man in the United Kingdom. But there we are.</p> <p>Think of the scone. It is the most contentious item of food in our society. That\u2019s why it was deliberately chosen to be hoovered into the vacuum of Johnson\u2019s body, by aides unseen. Cornwall and Devon have some sort of longstanding blood feud over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/poll/2010/may/20/cream-tea-scone-clotted-cream\" title=\"\">which order</a> you\u2019re supposed to do the jam and cream in (cream-first makes an unpalatable mess, that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying on the subject). It comes in either savoury (cheese) or sweet (currant, or \u201cunflavoured\u201d) versions, and nobody can seem to agree on which of them is correct. No other country on Earth gives a single solid shit about them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1199780448056041472\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u201cThe reason for putting the jam on first is because jam is adhesive\u201d <br><br>Conservative leader Boris Johnson prepares a scone, saying, when asked about the correct order of jam and cream, that he &quot;couldn&#39;t remember, so I guessed&quot;<a href=\"https://t.co/lbGIAxEpOv\">https://t.co/lbGIAxEpOv</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/9DKu3krqqT\">pic.twitter.com/9DKu3krqqT</a></p>&mdash; BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1199780448056041472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 27, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>You have, at some point in your life, met your significant others\u2019 family and discovered that, ah, they say scone differently to you, and had to have a smiling-but-not-really-smiling fight-but-not-really-fight with their dad about it that leads to him storming off to the garden to smoke exactly three cigarettes really quickly in a row. The scone was already a political issue before it entered the wet garbage can of Boris Johnson\u2019s mouth. If this goes much further an actual war might break out.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What order does cream go on a wreath, Boris? Can we maybe get Andrew Neil to ask him that?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Watching this video, it is particularly impossible to envision Johnson as the all-shagging ur-lothario the newspapers make him up to be. The man eats a scone with the elan of a toddler banned from the Play-Doh table at their third nursery in as many months because they keep mashing all the colours together. Look at him, smiling, cream smeared over his wet pink lips, the word \u201cDERICIOUS\u201d garbled through a mouth full of spit, the close shot of his eyes, watery and afraid. This?

      "bodyText": "With eyes open and hearts brave, we must watch this video of Boris Johnson eating a scone. This is what we\u2019ve come to: Boris Johnson eating a mediocre baked good is somehow a sort of galactic-brained version of everyman campaigning, a highpoint of election conversation, and a stunning and remarkable example of strategic nous. When really, it looks like grainy VHS footage of a toddler eating a cracker for the first time re-enacted by a man who, on every other version of Earth, is the village weirdo famed for acting erratically near urinals, and not, as we have it here on Earth-Prime, the most politically important man in the United Kingdom. But there we are. Think of the scone. It is the most contentious item of food in our society. That\u2019s why it was deliberately chosen to be hoovered into the vacuum of Johnson\u2019s body, by aides unseen. Cornwall and Devon have some sort of longstanding blood feud over which order you\u2019re supposed to do the jam and cream in (cream-first makes an unpalatable mess, that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying on the subject). It comes in either savoury (cheese) or sweet (currant, or \u201cunflavoured\u201d) versions, and nobody can seem to agree on which of them is correct. No other country on Earth gives a single solid shit about them. You have, at some point in your life, met your significant others\u2019 family and discovered that, ah, they say scone differently to you, and had to have a smiling-but-not-really-smiling fight-but-not-really-fight with their dad about it that leads to him storming off to the garden to smoke exactly three cigarettes really quickly in a row. The scone was already a political issue before it entered the wet garbage can of Boris Johnson\u2019s mouth. If this goes much further an actual war might break out. Watching this video, it is particularly impossible to envision Johnson as the all-shagging ur-lothario the newspapers make him up to be. The man eats a scone with the elan of a toddler banned from the Play-Doh table at their third nursery in as many months because they keep mashing all the colours together. Look at him, smiling, cream smeared over his wet pink lips, the word \u201cDERICIOUS\u201d garbled through a mouth full of spit, the close shot of his eyes, watery and afraid. This? This is your shagger god? Can we not, honestly, do better than that? Crucially, in the most contentious week of the election so far, in the wake of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s redacted dossier and the NHS scandal, amid frantic calls for the prime minister to face Andrew Neil for a grilling, and beneath louder and louder calls to investigate the impartiality of the BBC, why exactly has the broadcaster decided to tweet this, today? There\u2019s no news hook, there\u2019s no follow-up story where Johnson tucks his tie into his shirt and nods gravely at nurses, there\u2019s no flood to mop up. It\u2019s simply a 30-second chucklesome vid-bite about the prime minister charismatically not knowing what order jam goes on a scone. What order does cream go on a wreath, Boris? Can we maybe get Andrew Neil to ask him that? Other things to hate or enjoy \u2013 delete as appropriate Unfortunately for all of us, Michael Gove is still allowed unfettered access to the internet. To recap: on Tuesday, Gove commented that Stormzy, who had urged his young fans to register to vote, was a \u201cfar better rapper than he is a political analyst\u201d. Then he quote-tweeted a joke from Angela Rayner saying he was crap at both with the retort \u2013 and I am sorry to both of us here, both me for having to type it and you for having to read it, but try not to imagine Michael Gove\u2019s little pink face, floating like a balloon over the following sentence \u2013 \u201cI set trends dem man copy\u201d.

As has been discussed with far more nuance on these hallowed pages, Gove\u2019s comments were akin to the digital version of blackface, but also very crucially they were the first historical instance of someone putting not one foot in his mouth, not two, but somehow three, then five, then 10.

      "body": "<p>When Boris Johnson assumed office as prime minister in July 2019 and proceeded, without the mandate of a general election, to appoint a cabinet that was arguably one of the most rightwing in post-second world war British history, many commentators called it a coup. The free market thinktank the Institute of Economic Affairs felt self-congratulation was more in order, however. \u201cThis week, liberty-lovers witnessed some exciting developments,\u201d the IEA said in <a href=\"https://politicalemails.org/messages/8455\" title=\"\">an email</a> to its supporters. The organisation, whose mission is to shrink the state, lower taxes and deregulate business, noted that 14 of those around the Downing Street table \u2013 including the chancellor, Sajid Javid, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, and the home secretary, Priti Patel \u2013 were \u201calumni of IEA initiatives\u201d.</p> <p>The IEA had good reason to boast about its influence. Just a few years earlier, on the occasion of its 60th birthday in 2015, Javid <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/celebrating-60-years-of-the-institute-of-economic-affairs-iea\" title=\"\">had declared</a> that it had \u201creflected and deeply influenced my views, helping to develop the economic and political philosophy that guides me to this day\u201d. In a speech to the IEA the same year, Raab also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMNgUrVOWeY\" title=\"\">enthused about</a> the organisation\u2019s effect on his younger self. A few years back, he told the audience, he had been on a beach in Brazil. He\u2019d had a couple of drinks, and had gone in to the sea to mull over an idea: that New Labour had \u201ceroded liberty\u201d in Britain and created a \u201crights culture\u201d that had fostered a nation of idlers. Lost in thought, the tide had dragged him far from his starting point, and back on the beach, he had trouble locating his family among all the \u201cscantily clad Brazilians\u201d. On stage, he thanked the IEA for helping him develop this idea, which became the starting point for the book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\" title=\"\">Britannia Unchained</a>, an anti-statist tract, co-written with other MPs who would go on to join Johnson\u2019s new cabinet \u2013 Patel; Elizabeth Truss, now trade secretary; Kwasi Kwarteng, business minister; and Chris Skidmore, then health minister.</p> <p>The authors were also members of a parliamentary faction called the Free Enterprise Group, whose aim was to rebuild confidence in free market capitalism in the wake of the financial crisis, and for which the IEA has organised events, co-authored papers and provided administrative support. Other members included future Johnson ministers Andrea Leadsom, Matt Hancock, Robert Buckland, Julian Smith, Alister Jack, Alun Cairns, Jacob Rees-Mogg, James Cleverly and Brandon Lewis.</p> <p>Libertarian thinktanks in the US, such as the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) have had this sort of close relationship with incoming Republican administrations for years, furnishing them with staff and readymade policies. Thinktanks \u2013 non-governmental organisations that research policies with the aim of shaping government \u2013 have long been influential in British politics, too, on both left and right, but the sheer number of connections between Johnson\u2019s cabinet and ultra free market thinktanks was something new. In the period immediately before the Brexit referendum and in the years since, a stream of prominent British politicians and campaigners, including Johnson, Michael Gove, Nigel Farage and Arron Banks, have flown to the US to meet with thinktanks such as the AEI and the Heritage Foundation, often at the expense of those thinktanks, seeking out ideas, support and networking opportunities. Meanwhile, US thinktanks and their affiliates, which are largely funded by rightwing American billionaires and corporate donations, have teamed up with British politicians and London-based counterparts such as the IEA, the Legatum Institute and the Initiative for Free Trade, to help write detailed proposals for what the UK\u2019s departure from the EU, and its future relationships with both the EU and the US, should look like, raising questions about foreign influence on British politics.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/29/wealthy-us-donors-gave-millions-to-rightwing-uk-groups\">Wealthy US donors gave millions to rightwing UK groups</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The organisations involved in this collaboration between the US and UK radical right are partners in a global coalition of more than 450 thinktanks and campaign groups called the <a href=\"https://www.atlasnetwork.org/partners\" title=\"\">Atlas Network</a>, which has its headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. Members of the network operate independently but also cooperate closely in fighting for their shared vision of ultra free markets and limited government. They call themselves the \u201cworldwide freedom movement\u201d, collectively they have multimillion-dollar budgets, and many of their donors, board members, trustees and researchers overlap.</p> <p>Brad Lips, the chief executive of Atlas, <a href=\"https://www.atlasnetwork.org/assets/uploads/annual-reports/FreedomsChampion_Fall2017.pdf\" title=\"\">has said</a> that his organisation takes inspiration from monetarist economist Milton Friedman\u2019s famous insight that \u201conly a crisis \u2013 actual or perceived \u2013 produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive until the politically impossible becomes the politically inevitable.\u201d</p> <p>As an umbrella organisation, Atlas took no position on Brexit itself, and many of its European partners were opposed, but directors of UK groups in the network were prominent in the official campaign to take Britain out of the EU. Matthew Elliott, the chief executive of Vote Leave, was founder of the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, a pressure group to cut taxes, which is an Atlas partner. It also won <a href=\"https://www.taxpayersalliance.com/our_history\" title=\"\">lucrative prizes</a> from Atlas for its work. The Conservative MEP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/29/daniel-hannan-the-man-who-brought-you-brexit\" title=\"\">Daniel Hannan</a>, a long-term Eurosceptic and also a director of Vote Leave, has been a frequent visitor to the US Atlas partners, and went on to become director of two British thinktanks that were also in the network. The IEA took no position as an institution before the referendum, either, but its director, Mark Littlewood, <a href=\"https://www.atlasnetwork.org/freedoms-champion/issue/summer-2017\" title=\"\">explained in 2017</a>, in Freedom\u2019s Champion, the Atlas Network\u2019s quarterly magazine, why the leave victory was so galvanising for the libertarian movement: \u201cBrexit provides us with a once-in-a-generation opportunity to radically trim the size of the state and cut the regulatory burden.\u201d</p> <p>For many conservatives, Brexit was also an opportunity to revitalise the World Trade Organization and its drive towards unfettered globalised free trade, which had ground to a halt in 2014 as it became increasingly unpopular. Back in 2015, Raab predicted a \u201ctectonic struggle\u201d over the future of transatlantic trade in which \u201cthe IEA\u2019s strength will be like the warm, irresistible tide on that Brazilian beach, gently, powerfully, sometimes without us even knowing it, shifting the debate to a whole new place\u201d.</p> <p>After the referendum, thinktanks in the US and UK seized the crisis moment. Two UK Atlas partners, the IEA and the Legatum Institute, gained exceptional access to ministers as they advocated for a hard break from the EU and provided constant briefings to the radical Brexiter MPs in the European Research Group (ERG). \u201cThey had lots of meetings with ministers because politicians like people promising simple answers, but often those answers were not there,\u201d Raoul Ruparel, a former special adviser to Theresa May on Europe, told us.</p> <p>British voters, and even some MPs, are barely aware of the deep influence of these thinktanks, yet with help from members of this network, a once politically impossible kind of Brexit became inevitable. \u201cIt seemed almost faith-based,\u201d a senior Whitehall source said, \u201c[the idea that] \u2026 if only the UK would do a free trade agreement with the US, opening up almost unilaterally, it would be the equivalent of doing one with the whole world \u2013 prices would drop, we\u2019d all be better off.\u201d He added: \u201cIt was staggering, really. Not even Margaret Thatcher or monetarism at its height had contemplated such shock therapy.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Public policy thinktanks fall into different categories: some concentrate on neutral factual research, others have more fixed ideological positions and lobby for particular solutions. Some present themselves as scholarly institutes and call their researchers scholars or fellows, although they are as likely to have come from politics, lobbying, media or the law as from academia. Some thinktanks receive government funding, others depend on donations. They may be registered as private companies, or as not-for-profit charities. The latter status gives them and their donors substantial tax breaks but, in theory, also restricts how directly political their activities can be. In practice, the lines are blurred and are repeatedly the subject of dispute.</p> <p>The Atlas thinktanks are privately funded. Fossil fuel magnates, hedge fund and finance billionaires, and tobacco and oil companies have been prominent donors to partners in the network. These partners start from a shared ideology, which promotes self-reliance, market freedom and minimal tax and regulation. The EU, as a supranational form of government that favours reasonably strong regulation in areas such as data privacy, tax avoidance, finance, climate and the environment, is viewed by many of them as anathema.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bb31f7a8ac0fe0c37087278037735496881badca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb31f7a8ac0fe0c37087278037735496881badca/0_186_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In 2017, the then British trade secretary, Liam Fox, speaks at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In 2017, the then British trade secretary, Liam Fox, speaks at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington DC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul J Richards/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some leading US thinktanks in the network, such as the Heritage Foundation, also believe the EU\u2019s relationship with Britain has weakened the transatlantic alliance. \u201cThe Heritage Foundation is 100% in favour of Britain leaving the EU, with or without a deal,\u201d Nile Gardiner, director of the thinktank\u2019s Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, told us. \u201cWe believe Britain will be an even stronger partner for the US outside of the EU, which is increasingly anti-American.\u201d</p> <p>As an umbrella organisation, Atlas encourages what it calls \u201cpolicy entrepreneurs\u201d in thinktanks by offering coaching in fundraising, messaging and marketing. It makes grants, awards financial prizes and connects key figures with potential donors through its regular \u201cLiberty Forum\u201d gatherings. Partner thinktanks \u201chave to share the mission\u201d, but \u201cthe idea isn\u2019t that Atlas starts in the middle and tells everyone what to do\u201d, explained Linda Whetstone, who is the network\u2019s chair and a board member of the IEA. \u201cWe have a set of beliefs that we think enable human flourishing. Atlas sets up its stand and people come to us and say, \u2018that\u2019s what we want\u2019 \u2026 and then Atlas helps them do it.\u201d The Atlas ideology often aligns with its donors\u2019 financial interests, although its thinktanks claim that donors do not influence what they research. Several of the thinktanks also say that the views they publish are those of their affiliates rather than the official position of the institution.</p> <p>One key Atlas strategy involves using the media to shape the political debate. By encouraging the creation of more and more thinktanks \u2013 a never-ending production line of new \u201cinstitutes\u201d, \u201ccentres\u201d and \u201cfoundations\u201d, whose acronyms blur into each other \u2013 the network can generate a \u201cconstant river of commentary\u201d from its experts, says <a href=\"https://www.rapidtransition.org/about/our-people/\" title=\"\">Andrew Simms</a>, a veteran of environmental thinktanks who has often debated against members of Atlas-affiliated organisations. A predominantly rightwing British media have been happy to give them space. This gives the impression of widespread support for what may be minority or fringe points of view. The thinktanks\u2019 contribution to the post-referendum Brexit debate was a turbo-charged version of what they have long done on issues such as tax and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/10/vested-interests-public-against-climate-science-fossil-fuel-lobby\" title=\"\">climate</a>, where they have disputed the scientific consensus, argues Simms. \u201cIt\u2019s a belief system. They go very \u2018big picture\u2019 to shift the tide of opinion.\u201d</p> <p>Shahmir Sanni, a former pro-Brexit campaigner who volunteered for BeLeave, a campaign group directed at young voters before the referendum, has given an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/11/brexit-whistleblower-shahmir-sanni-taxpayers-alliance-concedes-it-launched-smears\" title=\"\">insider\u2019s description</a> of how he believed the British libertarian thinktanks exerted influence on the EU debate. After the referendum, Sanni was given a job at the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, but when he spoke to the press, alleging there had been coordination between BeLeave and Vote Leave, he was sacked, and subsequently won a case against his employer for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/11/brexit-whistleblower-shahmir-sanni-taxpayers-alliance-concedes-it-launched-smears\" title=\"\">unfair dismissal</a> in 2018. In his tribunal claim, Sanni described a nexus of organisations, including the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, the IEA, the Adam Smith Institute and two other Atlas network partners, as well as other non-Atlas campaign groups, which, he alleged, met regularly to agree a common line on issues relating to Brexit. By coordinating messaging they could garner more media coverage than a single organisation could achieve. \u201cTogether they present a lobbying group pursuing the same political agenda,\u201d Sanni said. (The organisations he identified have denied they act as lobbyists or as a co-ordinated grouping; they met to agree timings and avoid diary clashes for events, the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance <a href=\"https://www.taxpayersalliance.com/funding\" title=\"\">said</a>.)</p> <p>Alongside efforts to shape the media narrative, some Atlas thinktanks in the US have furthered their cause by writing blueprints for legislation for new governments. In 2017, Hannan set up his own new thinktank, the Initiative for Free Trade, which was an Atlas partner, to do something similar. The launch event took place at a Foreign Office venue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/22/johnson-foreign-secretary-facing-new-questions-over-use-fco-room-hard-brexit-thinktank\" title=\"\">with Johnson\u2019s help</a>. The IFT worked with nine other Atlas partners \u2013 including the Adam Smith Institute and the IEA in the UK, and the Cato Institute, the Mercatus Center and the Heritage Foundation in the US \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/18/rightwing-thinktanks-unveil-radical-plan-for-us-uk-brexit-trade-deal-nhs\" title=\"\">to draw up</a> a detailed, 239-page draft legal text for a US-UK free trade deal that would radically liberalise the UK economy, including opening up the NHS to foreign competition. The Cato Institute helped with funding, and the focus was \u201cnot the EU, but liberalising trade with the rest of the world as the best way to alleviate poverty and spread opportunity\u201d, Hannan told us. (IFT ceased being an Atlas partner in the summer of this year.)</p> <p>Atlas thinktanks in the US have become regular stops for key Brexiters. Javid, for example, made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/04/sajid-javid-combative-capitalist-and-courtier-of-us-neocons\" title=\"\">six trips</a> in the past eight years to the American Enterprise Institute\u2019s World Forum, its annual gathering of the rich and powerful on a private island resort in Georgia. Gove joined him there in 2018. Liam Fox, David Davis, Owen Paterson and Farage have given talks at the Heritage Foundation. Johnson flew to the AEI in 2018 at its expense to accept an award, and has met representatives from Heritage, too. Truss did a grand tour of Atlas US thinktanks for policy discussions last year. These US trips were important to Brexit politicians, Simms believes, because \u201cthey give you affirmation, they indicate you are part of the same club. It gives you a chance to align strategies and messaging. It\u2019s part of nurturing the shared project and rehearsing the script\u201d.</p> <p>We asked Oliver Letwin, the former Conservative minister who helped lead the Tory backbench rebellion against a no-deal Brexit, how influential he thought the free market thinktanks were. He said that occasionally they had shifted the political terrain, but mostly the dynamic worked the other way round. Earlier in his career, he recalled, he had commissioned some of the UK ones to write pamphlets \u2013 but only to justify what he had already decided to do: \u201cOne alights magpie-like on these, if they tend to your argument. But 95% of the reports they produce are just junk.\u201d He doubted they had played much role in Brexit policy. Why, then, did he think so many Conservative politicians had made trips to the US thinktanks? He seemed baffled by this. \u201c<em>Do</em> they? I have no idea.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The ambition to create a network of thinktanks that could drag the political debate to the right was conceived in the aftermath of the second world war. For more than two decades, following the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression, the theories of the Cambridge economist John Maynard Keynes had dominated political thinking in the US and UK. Keynes argued that governments should intervene in the market and use state planning and public spending to control booms and busts and unemployment. Challenging this orthodoxy were economists of the Austrian school, including Friedrich Hayek, who believed that state intervention made the market operate less efficiently and thus hampered the creation of wealth. Hayek believed that state planning wasn\u2019t just bad economics, but that it was politically disastrous and led to totalitarianism.</p> <p>One of Hayek\u2019s key texts, The Road to Serfdom, was published in abridged form in the Reader\u2019s Digest in 1945. For the British entrepreneur and former RAF pilot Antony Fisher, discovering Hayek was a life-changing event. Fisher sought out the academic, who was then teaching at the London School of Economics. Hayek advised Fisher not to waste his time taking up politics directly, but instead to set up a scholarly institute with the aim of shifting public opinion. The decisive influence in \u201cthe battle of ideas\u201d, Hayek said, was wielded by intellectuals in universities and by journalists, whom he called \u201csecond-hand dealers in ideas\u201d. If you really wanted to change politics, these were the people to target.</p> <p>First, Fisher worked to make his fortune, pioneering the factory farming of chicken for supermarket abattoirs. Then, in 1955, he used his money to set up the IEA with his friend, businessman Oliver Smedley. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/entries/fdb484c8-99a1-32a3-83be-20108374b985\" title=\"\">Smedley wrote</a> to Fisher at the time in correspondence unearthed later by BBC film-maker Adam Curtis that they would have to be \u201ccagey\u201d about what the thinktank\u2019s real function was: \u201cImperative that we should give no indication in our literature that we are working to educate the public along certain lines which might be interpreted as having a political bias.\u201d</p> <p>For the next 20 years, the IEA published a steady stream of papers on its free market themes. \u201cNo one took any notice for years and years,\u201d Whetstone, who is Fisher\u2019s daughter, recalled. But its staff were preparing the ground for an assault on the consensus, firing off what they called \u201c<a href=\"https://iea.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Blundell-interactive.pdf\" title=\"\">shells</a>\u201d. When the economic crises of the 1970s hit, these shells were lying around primed for use by politicians. Keith Joseph, the Tory minister and MP, who underwent a radical conversion to free markets and small government after the Conservative defeat in 1974, acknowledged a huge debt to the IEA. He became a close adviser to Thatcher, who went to meet Hayek at the IEA\u2019s offices, and she, too, was profoundly influenced by his analysis. Joseph set up his own free market thinktank, the Centre for Policy Studies, which later became an Atlas partner. Thatcherism grew out of the ideas of these two thinktanks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the late 60s and early 70s, as his long-term thinktank strategy was finally about to pay off, Fisher invested in a new enterprise in the tax haven of the Cayman Islands: turtle-farming. He also decided to sell his idea of the thinktank as agent of political change to another wealthy proponent of libertarianism, US fossil fuel magnate, Charles Koch. Koch and his brothers had inherited a vast fortune from their father in 1967 and were building up Koch Industries into the behemoth it is today. Fisher went on a mission to Wichita, Kansas, where the company had its headquarters.</p> <p>Charles Koch\u2019s right-hand man, George Pearson, <a href=\"https://www.atlasnetwork.org/assets/uploads/annual-reports/highlights/2008_winter_highlights.pdf\" title=\"\">described</a> Koch\u2019s meeting with Fisher as \u201cone of the more memorable dinners of my life\u201d: the two business titans discussed the merits of turtle-farming versus cattle-ranching and talked about how to \u201cspread freedom\u201d through thinktanks. Koch was already funding a libertarian thinktank and in 1974 he set up a new one, which was later renamed the <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/25th_annual_report.pdf\" title=\"\">Cato Institute</a>. It describes itself as \u201cdedicated to principles of individual liberty, limited government, free markets and peace\u201d.</p> <p>By the late 70s, Koch had adopted a three-part strategy to create a movement that aimed, <a href=\"https://www.libertarianism.org/publications/essays/business-community-resisting-regulation\" title=\"\">he said</a>, to \u201cdestroy the prevalent statist paradigm\u201d. It would involve lobbying government to repeal regulation of industries and all taxes, educating a new young \u201clibertarian cadre\u201d and funding politicians directly to win influence. Koch anticipated that bringing about this ideological shift would take decades, and he committed to the long haul. Like Fisher, Koch was an engineer by training, and he saw the libertarian effort as a kind of production line. In the mid-1990s, the president of the Charles Koch Foundation, Richard Fink, wrote <a href=\"https://kochdocs.org/2019/08/19/1996-structure-of-social-change-by-koch-industries-executive-vp-richard-fink/\" title=\"\">an essay</a> that laid out the Koch strategy for change. First, donate to universities in order to produce the necessary \u201cintellectual raw material\u201d. Second, donate to thinktanks, which then process this raw material into a \u201cusable form\u201d to be consumed by opinion formers. Third, donate to political advocacy groups, which have been characterised by critics as front groups whose function is to make politicians believe there is strong grassroots pressure for small-state, anti-welfare policies. These synthetic \u201cgrassroots\u201d groups were described by David Koch as their \u201csales force\u201d. Other billionaire-endowed thinktanks, such as the Heritage Foundation, adopted similar tactics.</p> <p>Fisher started his own thinktank proliferation project in the US in the late 70s. By then married to an American and living in California, he launched two more free market thinktanks and developed plans to \u201cbreed\u201d thinktanks \u201cwholesale\u201d, in the words of Friedman. \u201cAll these people wanted to know what he\u2019d done or how he\u2019d done it,\u201d Whetstone told us. So, in 1981 he launched the <a href=\"https://www.atlasnetwork.org/about/our-story\" title=\"\">Atlas Economic Research Foundation</a>, which would later evolve into the Atlas Network. The name, Whetstone thinks, was not based, as commonly believed, on the novel Atlas Shrugged by the writer and heroine of the libertarian movement Ayn Rand, whom Javid says he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/31/nationalisation-state-save-steel-port-talbot-tata-industrial-policy\" title=\"\">reads every year</a>. Instead, it was directly inspired by one of Fisher\u2019s favourite classical stories and the Greek mathematician Archimedes. In the myth of Atlas, the Greek god is condemned by Zeus to hold the weight of the world on his shoulders, while Archimedes said: \u201cGive me a lever ... and I will move the world.\u201d Fisher\u2019s thinktanks, together with those of his US billionaire friends, were to be the levers with which to move the world.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In the years since the referendum, two UK Atlas thinktanks have stood out for their influence over the Brexit debate: the Legatum Institute, a charitable foundation ultimately funded by a Dubai investment group, and Fisher\u2019s original champion of liberty, the IEA. Both thinktanks have been energetic at different points in pushing Britain towards a hard Brexit.</p> <p>A key figure in their efforts has been Shanker Singham, a British-American trade lawyer who worked extensively in the US, including as a lobbyist in Washington. He had previously been listed as an expert with the Atlas thinktank partner the Heartland Institute before joining the London-based Legatum in early 2016 as its director of economic policy. A reluctant remainer originally, Singham told us last year that he realised the leave vote was a \u201cmassive global event\u201d that could reboot the whole World Trade Organization. Soon after the referendum, he put together a \u201c<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20160807213943/https://li.com/events/launch-of-the-legatum-institute-special-trade-commission\" title=\"\">special trade commission</a>\u201d at Legatum to produce a roadmap for a post-Brexit world. His team included fellows from the Heritage Foundation and other Atlas thinktanks.</p> <p>Singham was an instant hit with the Tory party\u2019s hardcore Brexiters. The UK\u2019s trade negotiations had long been done through Brussels, and home-grown experts like him were in short supply. In September 2016, he helped to draw up a blueprint for a hard Brexit at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/david-davis-oxford-seminar-hard-brexit-eu\" title=\"\">a gathering</a> of leading Eurosceptics, including then Brexit secretary David Davis, at Oxford University. That same month in parliament, Steve Baker, then chair of the ERG \u2013 and himself the founder of an Atlas partner thinktank, the Cobden Centre \u2013 <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2016-09-08/debates/B7535980-40DD-43D1-BCA2-41814696A520/TradeNegotiatorsRecruitment?highlight=legatum#contribution-D1388A4A-B0CE-44ED-A35A-5BCE149BF471\" title=\"\">called on</a> the then trade secretary Liam Fox to make use of the work of Singham\u2019s \u201cfirst-class\u201d team \u201cat the Legatum Institute\u2019s special trade commission\u201d. In the months that followed, the approach taken by Davis\u2019s Brexit department appeared to follow much of what had been proposed at the Oxford meeting.</p> <p>Over the next year, Singham and Legatum\u2019s relationship with the Tory Brexiters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/23/shanker-singham-is-he-the-brains-of-brexit\" title=\"\">blossomed</a>. During this period, representatives from Legatum regularly met ministers including Davis, Johnson, Gove, Truss, Raab, Fox and Greg Hands. Referring to Singham, the senior Whitehall source said: \u201cHe gets about, doesn\u2019t he? You certainly have to say at the least that he was very, very good at networking.\u201d</p> <p>Philip Rycroft, the civil servant who was permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting the European Union (DexEU) from 2017 to 2019, who is also recorded in government transparency data as meeting Singham on a number of occasions, explained that ministers were keen for him to understand Singham\u2019s views on Brexit. \u201cMinisters said he had interesting thoughts. It\u2019s perfectly legitimate for them to say: \u2018Can you check him out for us?\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the sole channel to them.\u201d</p> <p>In late 2017, Singham\u2019s commission published a Legatum report, The Brexit Inflection Point, which was later found to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/01/pro-brexit-thinktank-legatum-institute-broke-charity-rules-politics-watchdog\" title=\"\">breached</a> Charity Commission rules for being too politically partisan. Legatum removed the report from its website and halted its Brexit work altogether in spring 2018. Around this time, Singham left Legatum to set up a new International Trade and Competition Unit at the IEA, keeping his Brexit work in the Atlas family.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6c80d53d3f72ddc05b7b7aa04957951208450648\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c80d53d3f72ddc05b7b7aa04957951208450648/0_183_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US fossil fuel magnate Charles Koch, who is a wealthy proponent of libertarianism.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US fossil fuel magnate Charles Koch, a wealthy proponent of libertarianism.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wichita Eagle/MCT/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the autumn of 2018, the ERG cranked up the pressure on Theresa May, with ammunition from the free market thinktanks, as Brexit negotiations reached a crunch point. In July, May\u2019s \u201cChequers plan\u201d, which included regulatory alignment with the EU and an Irish backstop keeping the UK in a customs union, fell apart just days after ministers had agreed to it. By the time MPs returned from the summer recess in September, they found the political agenda seized by the ERG, which made a series of orchestrated media announcements. Baker coordinated these through a WhatsApp group. What followed looked like a good example of well-worn Atlas strategies at work \u2013 capture the political narrative through the media, use different groups to maximise coverage, work to shift the overall climate of opinion.</p> <p>Reports had begun to appear in the media, based on briefings from anonymous sources, that Davis was <a href=\"https://www.cityam.com/david-davis-aims-see-off-chequers-backing-new-plan-canada/\" title=\"\">working with the IEA</a> to deliver a 140-page alternative to May\u2019s plan. Yet it failed to materialise, reportedly after ERG members were unable to agree on some of its wilder ideas, which included a military expeditionary force to defend the Falkland Islands. Instead, on 11 September, a little-known organisation, Economists for Free Trade, launched its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/11/brexit-one-plus-one-equals-a-trillion-economists-for-free-trade\" title=\"\">vision for Brexit</a>, which involved walking away from an EU trade deal and reverting to WTO rules. The economist speaking on the panel at its launch event was <a href=\"https://iea.org.uk/trustees/\" title=\"\">Prof Patrick Minford</a>, trustee of and veteran contributor to the IEA; he was introduced by the then ERG chairman, Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was also an adviser to Economists for Free Trade.</p> <p>The next day, the ERG produced another paper, this time on how to solve the Irish border problem. The ERG held a launch event in London, and a blog founded after the referendum, Brexit Central, which was edited by the former policy director of the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, published the paper online. Separately, a few days later, Hannan\u2019s Initiative for Free Trade <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/18/rightwing-thinktanks-unveil-radical-plan-for-us-uk-brexit-trade-deal-nhs\" title=\"\">launched</a> his \u201cideal US-UK free trade deal\u201d, the collaboration between UK and US Atlas thinktanks. The following week, the IEA launched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/24/iea-brexit-proposals-the-main-points\" title=\"\">Plan A+</a>, its own radical proposal for a Canada-style free trade deal, drawn up by Singham and his team. The ERG supported the launch and Johnson took to Twitter to declare it a \u201cfine piece of work by @shankerasingham @iealondon\u201d.</p> <p>There was a puzzling circularity to all this activity generated by separate organisations, which, on closer inspection, turned out to be connected. The merits or otherwise of the proposals were almost beside the point. They captured the news agenda day after day, creating a tide of commentary and headlines. \u201cBecause broadcasters often fail to match Brexiters with trade experts, they get away with their nonsense,\u201d Simon Wren-Lewis, professor of economics at Oxford University, <a href=\"https://mainlymacro.blogspot.com/2018/05/brexiter-nonsense-and-policy.html\" title=\"\">has noted</a>. \u201cBy the time the nonsense is revealed as such, and enough people know why it is nonsense, the discussion has moved on and new nonsense appears.\u201d</p> <p>In November 2018, the Charity Commission told the IEA to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/01/iea-brexit-jacob-rees-mogg-charity-commission\" title=\"\">take down</a> Singham\u2019s Plan A+ for being too politically biased. This year, it was <a href=\"https://iea.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Plan-A-Republished-Sept-2019.pdf\" title=\"\">republished</a>, with 3,184 revisions to the original document. Meanwhile, Singham continues to work with ministers and the ERG through his private consultancy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/08/key-figure-in-tory-brexit-talks-owns-firm-giving-advice-on-eu-exit\" title=\"\">Competere, and another new thinktank</a>.</p> <p>Ruparel, the former special adviser to the prime minister on Europe, recalled having to analyse all the thinktank proposals with officials that autumn to brief the prime minister on them. He had worked for an Atlas thinktank partner, Open Europe, \u201ccommenting on the game from the sidelines\u201d, before becoming a special adviser to Davis in 2016, and later to May. In government, he told us, actually trying to deliver practical policies was easier said than done. He said the ERG blitz was stressful but that its proposals had \u201czero impact\u201d on negotiations under May in the end. \u201cIt was all stuff we\u2019d looked at before and dismissed because it was non-negotiable with the EU,\u201d he told us. But did it shift the tide of opinion against the prime minister? \u201cDid these ideas start the political pressure on Mrs May or was the pressure there and politicians picked up these thinktank ideas to make their point? It\u2019s a judgment call,\u201d he said.</p> <p>According to the senior Whitehall source: \u201cIt was a pretty unsettling time. We were very conscious some ministers had bought in to this stuff and you were in between two very strongly held ideological positions, one of them supported by thinktank people who had the ability to turn out papers very fast. It didn\u2019t make life easy. But despite an awful lot of ink being spilt and lots and lots of meetings, they never came up with an answer that sorted out the Irish border. There was a gap between the ideologically driven wish and the hard reality.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>One striking thing, talking to current and former Conservative MPs, is how little they seem to know about the influence of key thinktanks in the Atlas Network. Anna Soubry, the former Conservative minister and advocate of a second referendum, acknowledged to us that the ERG\u2019s sustained campaign of media events in autumn 2018 had been \u201chugely significant\u201d, but she was not aware of the thinktank work behind it.</p> <p>\u201cThe clique that think about Europe and nothing else now dominate every aspect of the party,\u201d said Margot James, the former Conservative digital and culture minister. \u201cIt\u2019s just different to the one I joined.\u201d When James entered parliament in 2010, she became a member of the Free Enterprise Group and went to IEA events, but eventually found the thinktank\u2019s views too rigidly ideological. James now feels that a number of MPs have adopted the IEA\u2019s ideas \u201clock, stock and barrel\u201d and that Johnson had surrounded himself with \u201cdogmatic small-state\u201d conservatives. \u201cOh, there are people at No 10 who would honestly make your hair stand on end,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Amid the febrile political atmosphere post-referendum, some remainers have seized upon the personal and organisational connections linking the many Atlas thinktanks. The Labour and Green parties have accused anonymous donors of failing to identify their <a href=\"https://thebrexitsyndicate.com/\" title=\"\">real agenda</a>, and of using these organisations to undermine British democracy; the Brexit referendum was never presented to the electorate as a way to return to unfettered globalisation, they argue. The thinktanks have also been accused of allowing undeclared donors to influence their research. All of these allegations have been vigorously denied.</p> <p>After the referendum, Elliott, the former Vote Leave director, became a fellow of the Legatum Institute for a period, researching populism and going on a speaking tour of the US. He visited \u201cold friends\u201d at the Heritage Foundation and four other Atlas Network thinktanks to share lessons from the victorious campaign and to make the case for Brexit as a great opportunity for the US-UK trade. He also became an <a href=\"https://www.atlasnetwork.org/about/people/matthew-elliott\" title=\"\">Atlas Network mentor</a>. As far as he is concerned, the Atlas Network had nothing to do with the Brexit campaign. He told us he was bemused by the \u201cspider diagrams\u201d drawn by leftwing campaign groups that link Brexit to the influence of undeclared thinktank funders in the UK and the US. \u201cIt\u2019s verging on conspiracy theory,\u201d he said. His view is that the result of the Brexit referendum came as such a shock to many remainers that they are desperate to find any alternative explanation rather than accept the fact that the British public wanted to leave the EU.</p> <p>Last year, investigators from Greenpeace\u2019s Unearthed journalism team <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/30/brexit-influencing-game-iea-us-rancher-tucker-link\" title=\"\">covertly recorded</a> the head of yet another US Atlas thinktank, the E Foundation For Oklahoma, saying his group was planning to raise money to give to the IEA to campaign on Brexit. Littlewood, the IEA\u2019s director, boasted on film that he was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/29/rightwing-thinktank-ministerial-access-potential-us-donors-insitute-of-economic-affairs-brexit\" title=\"\">in the Brexit influencing game</a>\u201d, and said he had completed a lucrative tour of US donors. When the footage was published, the IEA denied that it had received any cash from US businesses in relation to its work on trade and Brexit, and stated that it did not recognise the sums of money being suggested by the E Foundation.</p> <p>In recent years, US Atlas partners, under sustained criticism over their funding, have become more transparent in listing many of their donors. By trawling their annual accounts, US tax returns, and grant databases from US foundations, it is possible to identify some of the major donors to US Atlas thinktanks that have hosted prominent British Brexiters or teamed up with them to produce material. Foundations associated with the Koch brothers have been major funders of the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, the American Enterprise Institute, the Manhattan Institute, the <a href=\"https://www.desmogblog.com/mercatus-center\" title=\"\">Mercatus Center</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.desmogblog.com/competitive-enterprise-institute\" title=\"\">Competitive Enterprise Institute</a>. These same thinktanks have also received funding variously from other foundations connected to US plutocrats, including the ultra-conservative Bradley, Scaife and John Templeton foundations. The family foundation of hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer has been a major donor to the Heritage Foundation and the Cato Institute.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/29/the-us-donors-who-gave-generously-to-rightwing-uk-groups\">The US donors who gave generously to rightwing UK groups</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Atlas Network, as an umbrella organisation, has also received multimillion-dollar funding for its worldwide activity in recent years from foundations set up by the Koch, Scaife, Bradley, Earhart and Templeton families.

      "bodyText": "When Boris Johnson assumed office as prime minister in July 2019 and proceeded, without the mandate of a general election, to appoint a cabinet that was arguably one of the most rightwing in post-second world war British history, many commentators called it a coup. The free market thinktank the Institute of Economic Affairs felt self-congratulation was more in order, however. \u201cThis week, liberty-lovers witnessed some exciting developments,\u201d the IEA said in an email to its supporters. The organisation, whose mission is to shrink the state, lower taxes and deregulate business, noted that 14 of those around the Downing Street table \u2013 including the chancellor, Sajid Javid, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, and the home secretary, Priti Patel \u2013 were \u201calumni of IEA initiatives\u201d. The IEA had good reason to boast about its influence. Just a few years earlier, on the occasion of its 60th birthday in 2015, Javid had declared that it had \u201creflected and deeply influenced my views, helping to develop the economic and political philosophy that guides me to this day\u201d. In a speech to the IEA the same year, Raab also enthused about the organisation\u2019s effect on his younger self. A few years back, he told the audience, he had been on a beach in Brazil. He\u2019d had a couple of drinks, and had gone in to the sea to mull over an idea: that New Labour had \u201ceroded liberty\u201d in Britain and created a \u201crights culture\u201d that had fostered a nation of idlers. Lost in thought, the tide had dragged him far from his starting point, and back on the beach, he had trouble locating his family among all the \u201cscantily clad Brazilians\u201d. On stage, he thanked the IEA for helping him develop this idea, which became the starting point for the book Britannia Unchained, an anti-statist tract, co-written with other MPs who would go on to join Johnson\u2019s new cabinet \u2013 Patel; Elizabeth Truss, now trade secretary; Kwasi Kwarteng, business minister; and Chris Skidmore, then health minister. The authors were also members of a parliamentary faction called the Free Enterprise Group, whose aim was to rebuild confidence in free market capitalism in the wake of the financial crisis, and for which the IEA has organised events, co-authored papers and provided administrative support. Other members included future Johnson ministers Andrea Leadsom, Matt Hancock, Robert Buckland, Julian Smith, Alister Jack, Alun Cairns, Jacob Rees-Mogg, James Cleverly and Brandon Lewis. Libertarian thinktanks in the US, such as the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) have had this sort of close relationship with incoming Republican administrations for years, furnishing them with staff and readymade policies. Thinktanks \u2013 non-governmental organisations that research policies with the aim of shaping government \u2013 have long been influential in British politics, too, on both left and right, but the sheer number of connections between Johnson\u2019s cabinet and ultra free market thinktanks was something new. In the period immediately before the Brexit referendum and in the years since, a stream of prominent British politicians and campaigners, including Johnson, Michael Gove, Nigel Farage and Arron Banks, have flown to the US to meet with thinktanks such as the AEI and the Heritage Foundation, often at the expense of those thinktanks, seeking out ideas, support and networking opportunities. Meanwhile, US thinktanks and their affiliates, which are largely funded by rightwing American billionaires and corporate donations, have teamed up with British politicians and London-based counterparts such as the IEA, the Legatum Institute and the Initiative for Free Trade, to help write detailed proposals for what the UK\u2019s departure from the EU, and its future relationships with both the EU and the US, should look like, raising questions about foreign influence on British politics. The organisations involved in this collaboration between the US and UK radical right are partners in a global coalition of more than 450 thinktanks and campaign groups called the Atlas Network, which has its headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. Members of the network operate independently but also cooperate closely in fighting for their shared vision of ultra free markets and limited government. They call themselves the \u201cworldwide freedom movement\u201d, collectively they have multimillion-dollar budgets, and many of their donors, board members, trustees and researchers overlap. Brad Lips, the chief executive of Atlas, has said that his organisation takes inspiration from monetarist economist Milton Friedman\u2019s famous insight that \u201conly a crisis \u2013 actual or perceived \u2013 produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive until the politically impossible becomes the politically inevitable.\u201d As an umbrella organisation, Atlas took no position on Brexit itself, and many of its European partners were opposed, but directors of UK groups in the network were prominent in the official campaign to take Britain out of the EU. Matthew Elliott, the chief executive of Vote Leave, was founder of the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, a pressure group to cut taxes, which is an Atlas partner. It also won lucrative prizes from Atlas for its work. The Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan, a long-term Eurosceptic and also a director of Vote Leave, has been a frequent visitor to the US Atlas partners, and went on to become director of two British thinktanks that were also in the network. The IEA took no position as an institution before the referendum, either, but its director, Mark Littlewood, explained in 2017, in Freedom\u2019s Champion, the Atlas Network\u2019s quarterly magazine, why the leave victory was so galvanising for the libertarian movement: \u201cBrexit provides us with a once-in-a-generation opportunity to radically trim the size of the state and cut the regulatory burden.\u201d For many conservatives, Brexit was also an opportunity to revitalise the World Trade Organization and its drive towards unfettered globalised free trade, which had ground to a halt in 2014 as it became increasingly unpopular. Back in 2015, Raab predicted a \u201ctectonic struggle\u201d over the future of transatlantic trade in which \u201cthe IEA\u2019s strength will be like the warm, irresistible tide on that Brazilian beach, gently, powerfully, sometimes without us even knowing it, shifting the debate to a whole new place\u201d. After the referendum, thinktanks in the US and UK seized the crisis moment. Two UK Atlas partners, the IEA and the Legatum Institute, gained exceptional access to ministers as they advocated for a hard break from the EU and provided constant briefings to the radical Brexiter MPs in the European Research Group (ERG). \u201cThey had lots of meetings with ministers because politicians like people promising simple answers, but often those answers were not there,\u201d Raoul Ruparel, a former special adviser to Theresa May on Europe, told us. British voters, and even some MPs, are barely aware of the deep influence of these thinktanks, yet with help from members of this network, a once politically impossible kind of Brexit became inevitable. \u201cIt seemed almost faith-based,\u201d a senior Whitehall source said, \u201c[the idea that] \u2026 if only the UK would do a free trade agreement with the US, opening up almost unilaterally, it would be the equivalent of doing one with the whole world \u2013 prices would drop, we\u2019d all be better off.\u201d He added: \u201cIt was staggering, really. Not even Margaret Thatcher or monetarism at its height had contemplated such shock therapy.\u201d * * * Public policy thinktanks fall into different categories: some concentrate on neutral factual research, others have more fixed ideological positions and lobby for particular solutions. Some present themselves as scholarly institutes and call their researchers scholars or fellows, although they are as likely to have come from politics, lobbying, media or the law as from academia. Some thinktanks receive government funding, others depend on donations. They may be registered as private companies, or as not-for-profit charities. The latter status gives them and their donors substantial tax breaks but, in theory, also restricts how directly political their activities can be. In practice, the lines are blurred and are repeatedly the subject of dispute. The Atlas thinktanks are privately funded. Fossil fuel magnates, hedge fund and finance billionaires, and tobacco and oil companies have been prominent donors to partners in the network. These partners start from a shared ideology, which promotes self-reliance, market freedom and minimal tax and regulation. The EU, as a supranational form of government that favours reasonably strong regulation in areas such as data privacy, tax avoidance, finance, climate and the environment, is viewed by many of them as anathema. Some leading US thinktanks in the network, such as the Heritage Foundation, also believe the EU\u2019s relationship with Britain has weakened the transatlantic alliance. \u201cThe Heritage Foundation is 100% in favour of Britain leaving the EU, with or without a deal,\u201d Nile Gardiner, director of the thinktank\u2019s Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, told us. \u201cWe believe Britain will be an even stronger partner for the US outside of the EU, which is increasingly anti-American.\u201d As an umbrella organisation, Atlas encourages what it calls \u201cpolicy entrepreneurs\u201d in thinktanks by offering coaching in fundraising, messaging and marketing. It makes grants, awards financial prizes and connects key figures with potential donors through its regular \u201cLiberty Forum\u201d gatherings. Partner thinktanks \u201chave to share the mission\u201d, but \u201cthe idea isn\u2019t that Atlas starts in the middle and tells everyone what to do\u201d, explained Linda Whetstone, who is the network\u2019s chair and a board member of the IEA. \u201cWe have a set of beliefs that we think enable human flourishing. Atlas sets up its stand and people come to us and say, \u2018that\u2019s what we want\u2019 \u2026 and then Atlas helps them do it.\u201d The Atlas ideology often aligns with its donors\u2019 financial interests, although its thinktanks claim that donors do not influence what they research. Several of the thinktanks also say that the views they publish are those of their affiliates rather than the official position of the institution. One key Atlas strategy involves using the media to shape the political debate. By encouraging the creation of more and more thinktanks \u2013 a never-ending production line of new \u201cinstitutes\u201d, \u201ccentres\u201d and \u201cfoundations\u201d, whose acronyms blur into each other \u2013 the network can generate a \u201cconstant river of commentary\u201d from its experts, says Andrew Simms, a veteran of environmental thinktanks who has often debated against members of Atlas-affiliated organisations. A predominantly rightwing British media have been happy to give them space. This gives the impression of widespread support for what may be minority or fringe points of view. The thinktanks\u2019 contribution to the post-referendum Brexit debate was a turbo-charged version of what they have long done on issues such as tax and climate, where they have disputed the scientific consensus, argues Simms. \u201cIt\u2019s a belief system. They go very \u2018big picture\u2019 to shift the tide of opinion.\u201d Shahmir Sanni, a former pro-Brexit campaigner who volunteered for BeLeave, a campaign group directed at young voters before the referendum, has given an insider\u2019s description of how he believed the British libertarian thinktanks exerted influence on the EU debate. After the referendum, Sanni was given a job at the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, but when he spoke to the press, alleging there had been coordination between BeLeave and Vote Leave, he was sacked, and subsequently won a case against his employer for unfair dismissal in 2018. In his tribunal claim, Sanni described a nexus of organisations, including the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, the IEA, the Adam Smith Institute and two other Atlas network partners, as well as other non-Atlas campaign groups, which, he alleged, met regularly to agree a common line on issues relating to Brexit. By coordinating messaging they could garner more media coverage than a single organisation could achieve. \u201cTogether they present a lobbying group pursuing the same political agenda,\u201d Sanni said. (The organisations he identified have denied they act as lobbyists or as a co-ordinated grouping; they met to agree timings and avoid diary clashes for events, the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance said.) Alongside efforts to shape the media narrative, some Atlas thinktanks in the US have furthered their cause by writing blueprints for legislation for new governments. In 2017, Hannan set up his own new thinktank, the Initiative for Free Trade, which was an Atlas partner, to do something similar. The launch event took place at a Foreign Office venue with Johnson\u2019s help. The IFT worked with nine other Atlas partners \u2013 including the Adam Smith Institute and the IEA in the UK, and the Cato Institute, the Mercatus Center and the Heritage Foundation in the US \u2013 to draw up a detailed, 239-page draft legal text for a US-UK free trade deal that would radically liberalise the UK economy, including opening up the NHS to foreign competition. The Cato Institute helped with funding, and the focus was \u201cnot the EU, but liberalising trade with the rest of the world as the best way to alleviate poverty and spread opportunity\u201d, Hannan told us. (IFT ceased being an Atlas partner in the summer of this year.) Atlas thinktanks in the US have become regular stops for key Brexiters. Javid, for example, made six trips in the past eight years to the American Enterprise Institute\u2019s World Forum, its annual gathering of the rich and powerful on a private island resort in Georgia. Gove joined him there in 2018. Liam Fox, David Davis, Owen Paterson and Farage have given talks at the Heritage Foundation. Johnson flew to the AEI in 2018 at its expense to accept an award, and has met representatives from Heritage, too. Truss did a grand tour of Atlas US thinktanks for policy discussions last year. These US trips were important to Brexit politicians, Simms believes, because \u201cthey give you affirmation, they indicate you are part of the same club. It gives you a chance to align strategies and messaging. It\u2019s part of nurturing the shared project and rehearsing the script\u201d. We asked Oliver Letwin, the former Conservative minister who helped lead the Tory backbench rebellion against a no-deal Brexit, how influential he thought the free market thinktanks were. He said that occasionally they had shifted the political terrain, but mostly the dynamic worked the other way round. Earlier in his career, he recalled, he had commissioned some of the UK ones to write pamphlets \u2013 but only to justify what he had already decided to do: \u201cOne alights magpie-like on these, if they tend to your argument. But 95% of the reports they produce are just junk.\u201d He doubted they had played much role in Brexit policy. Why, then, did he think so many Conservative politicians had made trips to the US thinktanks? He seemed baffled by this. \u201cDo they? I have no idea.\u201d * * * The ambition to create a network of thinktanks that could drag the political debate to the right was conceived in the aftermath of the second world war. For more than two decades, following the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression, the theories of the Cambridge economist John Maynard Keynes had dominated political thinking in the US and UK. Keynes argued that governments should intervene in the market and use state planning and public spending to control booms and busts and unemployment. Challenging this orthodoxy were economists of the Austrian school, including Friedrich Hayek, who believed that state intervention made the market operate less efficiently and thus hampered the creation of wealth. Hayek believed that state planning wasn\u2019t just bad economics, but that it was politically disastrous and led to totalitarianism. One of Hayek\u2019s key texts, The Road to Serfdom, was published in abridged form in the Reader\u2019s Digest in 1945. For the British entrepreneur and former RAF pilot Antony Fisher, discovering Hayek was a life-changing event. Fisher sought out the academic, who was then teaching at the London School of Economics. Hayek advised Fisher not to waste his time taking up politics directly, but instead to set up a scholarly institute with the aim of shifting public opinion. The decisive influence in \u201cthe battle of ideas\u201d, Hayek said, was wielded by intellectuals in universities and by journalists, whom he called \u201csecond-hand dealers in ideas\u201d. If you really wanted to change politics, these were the people to target. First, Fisher worked to make his fortune, pioneering the factory farming of chicken for supermarket abattoirs. Then, in 1955, he used his money to set up the IEA with his friend, businessman Oliver Smedley. Smedley wrote to Fisher at the time in correspondence unearthed later by BBC film-maker Adam Curtis that they would have to be \u201ccagey\u201d about what the thinktank\u2019s real function was: \u201cImperative that we should give no indication in our literature that we are working to educate the public along certain lines which might be interpreted as having a political bias.\u201d For the next 20 years, the IEA published a steady stream of papers on its free market themes. \u201cNo one took any notice for years and years,\u201d Whetstone, who is Fisher\u2019s daughter, recalled. But its staff were preparing the ground for an assault on the consensus, firing off what they called \u201cshells\u201d. When the economic crises of the 1970s hit, these shells were lying around primed for use by politicians. Keith Joseph, the Tory minister and MP, who underwent a radical conversion to free markets and small government after the Conservative defeat in 1974, acknowledged a huge debt to the IEA. He became a close adviser to Thatcher, who went to meet Hayek at the IEA\u2019s offices, and she, too, was profoundly influenced by his analysis. Joseph set up his own free market thinktank, the Centre for Policy Studies, which later became an Atlas partner. Thatcherism grew out of the ideas of these two thinktanks. In the late 60s and early 70s, as his long-term thinktank strategy was finally about to pay off, Fisher invested in a new enterprise in the tax haven of the Cayman Islands: turtle-farming. He also decided to sell his idea of the thinktank as agent of political change to another wealthy proponent of libertarianism, US fossil fuel magnate, Charles Koch. Koch and his brothers had inherited a vast fortune from their father in 1967 and were building up Koch Industries into the behemoth it is today. Fisher went on a mission to Wichita, Kansas, where the company had its headquarters. Charles Koch\u2019s right-hand man, George Pearson, described Koch\u2019s meeting with Fisher as \u201cone of the more memorable dinners of my life\u201d: the two business titans discussed the merits of turtle-farming versus cattle-ranching and talked about how to \u201cspread freedom\u201d through thinktanks. Koch was already funding a libertarian thinktank and in 1974 he set up a new one, which was later renamed the Cato Institute. It describes itself as \u201cdedicated to principles of individual liberty, limited government, free markets and peace\u201d. By the late 70s, Koch had adopted a three-part strategy to create a movement that aimed, he said, to \u201cdestroy the prevalent statist paradigm\u201d. It would involve lobbying government to repeal regulation of industries and all taxes, educating a new young \u201clibertarian cadre\u201d and funding politicians directly to win influence. Koch anticipated that bringing about this ideological shift would take decades, and he committed to the long haul. Like Fisher, Koch was an engineer by training, and he saw the libertarian effort as a kind of production line. In the mid-1990s, the president of the Charles Koch Foundation, Richard Fink, wrote an essay that laid out the Koch strategy for change. First, donate to universities in order to produce the necessary \u201cintellectual raw material\u201d. Second, donate to thinktanks, which then process this raw material into a \u201cusable form\u201d to be consumed by opinion formers. Third, donate to political advocacy groups, which have been characterised by critics as front groups whose function is to make politicians believe there is strong grassroots pressure for small-state, anti-welfare policies. These synthetic \u201cgrassroots\u201d groups were described by David Koch as their \u201csales force\u201d. Other billionaire-endowed thinktanks, such as the Heritage Foundation, adopted similar tactics. Fisher started his own thinktank proliferation project in the US in the late 70s. By then married to an American and living in California, he launched two more free market thinktanks and developed plans to \u201cbreed\u201d thinktanks \u201cwholesale\u201d, in the words of Friedman. \u201cAll these people wanted to know what he\u2019d done or how he\u2019d done it,\u201d Whetstone told us. So, in 1981 he launched the Atlas Economic Research Foundation, which would later evolve into the Atlas Network. The name, Whetstone thinks, was not based, as commonly believed, on the novel Atlas Shrugged by the writer and heroine of the libertarian movement Ayn Rand, whom Javid says he reads every year. Instead, it was directly inspired by one of Fisher\u2019s favourite classical stories and the Greek mathematician Archimedes. In the myth of Atlas, the Greek god is condemned by Zeus to hold the weight of the world on his shoulders, while Archimedes said: \u201cGive me a lever ... and I will move the world.\u201d Fisher\u2019s thinktanks, together with those of his US billionaire friends, were to be the levers with which to move the world. * * * In the years since the referendum, two UK Atlas thinktanks have stood out for their influence over the Brexit debate: the Legatum Institute, a charitable foundation ultimately funded by a Dubai investment group, and Fisher\u2019s original champion of liberty, the IEA. Both thinktanks have been energetic at different points in pushing Britain towards a hard Brexit. A key figure in their efforts has been Shanker Singham, a British-American trade lawyer who worked extensively in the US, including as a lobbyist in Washington. He had previously been listed as an expert with the Atlas thinktank partner the Heartland Institute before joining the London-based Legatum in early 2016 as its director of economic policy. A reluctant remainer originally, Singham told us last year that he realised the leave vote was a \u201cmassive global event\u201d that could reboot the whole World Trade Organization. Soon after the referendum, he put together a \u201cspecial trade commission\u201d at Legatum to produce a roadmap for a post-Brexit world. His team included fellows from the Heritage Foundation and other Atlas thinktanks. Singham was an instant hit with the Tory party\u2019s hardcore Brexiters. The UK\u2019s trade negotiations had long been done through Brussels, and home-grown experts like him were in short supply. In September 2016, he helped to draw up a blueprint for a hard Brexit at a gathering of leading Eurosceptics, including then Brexit secretary David Davis, at Oxford University. That same month in parliament, Steve Baker, then chair of the ERG \u2013 and himself the founder of an Atlas partner thinktank, the Cobden Centre \u2013 called on the then trade secretary Liam Fox to make use of the work of Singham\u2019s \u201cfirst-class\u201d team \u201cat the Legatum Institute\u2019s special trade commission\u201d. In the months that followed, the approach taken by Davis\u2019s Brexit department appeared to follow much of what had been proposed at the Oxford meeting. Over the next year, Singham and Legatum\u2019s relationship with the Tory Brexiters blossomed. During this period, representatives from Legatum regularly met ministers including Davis, Johnson, Gove, Truss, Raab, Fox and Greg Hands. Referring to Singham, the senior Whitehall source said: \u201cHe gets about, doesn\u2019t he? You certainly have to say at the least that he was very, very good at networking.\u201d Philip Rycroft, the civil servant who was permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting the European Union (DexEU) from 2017 to 2019, who is also recorded in government transparency data as meeting Singham on a number of occasions, explained that ministers were keen for him to understand Singham\u2019s views on Brexit. \u201cMinisters said he had interesting thoughts. It\u2019s perfectly legitimate for them to say: \u2018Can you check him out for us?\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the sole channel to them.\u201d In late 2017, Singham\u2019s commission published a Legatum report, The Brexit Inflection Point, which was later found to have breached Charity Commission rules for being too politically partisan. Legatum removed the report from its website and halted its Brexit work altogether in spring 2018. Around this time, Singham left Legatum to set up a new International Trade and Competition Unit at the IEA, keeping his Brexit work in the Atlas family. In the autumn of 2018, the ERG cranked up the pressure on Theresa May, with ammunition from the free market thinktanks, as Brexit negotiations reached a crunch point. In July, May\u2019s \u201cChequers plan\u201d, which included regulatory alignment with the EU and an Irish backstop keeping the UK in a customs union, fell apart just days after ministers had agreed to it. By the time MPs returned from the summer recess in September, they found the political agenda seized by the ERG, which made a series of orchestrated media announcements. Baker coordinated these through a WhatsApp group. What followed looked like a good example of well-worn Atlas strategies at work \u2013 capture the political narrative through the media, use different groups to maximise coverage, work to shift the overall climate of opinion. Reports had begun to appear in the media, based on briefings from anonymous sources, that Davis was working with the IEA to deliver a 140-page alternative to May\u2019s plan. Yet it failed to materialise, reportedly after ERG members were unable to agree on some of its wilder ideas, which included a military expeditionary force to defend the Falkland Islands. Instead, on 11 September, a little-known organisation, Economists for Free Trade, launched its vision for Brexit, which involved walking away from an EU trade deal and reverting to WTO rules. The economist speaking on the panel at its launch event was Prof Patrick Minford, trustee of and veteran contributor to the IEA; he was introduced by the then ERG chairman, Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was also an adviser to Economists for Free Trade. The next day, the ERG produced another paper, this time on how to solve the Irish border problem. The ERG held a launch event in London, and a blog founded after the referendum, Brexit Central, which was edited by the former policy director of the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, published the paper online. Separately, a few days later, Hannan\u2019s Initiative for Free Trade launched his \u201cideal US-UK free trade deal\u201d, the collaboration between UK and US Atlas thinktanks. The following week, the IEA launched Plan A+, its own radical proposal for a Canada-style free trade deal, drawn up by Singham and his team. The ERG supported the launch and Johnson took to Twitter to declare it a \u201cfine piece of work by @shankerasingham @iealondon\u201d. There was a puzzling circularity to all this activity generated by separate organisations, which, on closer inspection, turned out to be connected. The merits or otherwise of the proposals were almost beside the point. They captured the news agenda day after day, creating a tide of commentary and headlines. \u201cBecause broadcasters often fail to match Brexiters with trade experts, they get away with their nonsense,\u201d Simon Wren-Lewis, professor of economics at Oxford University, has noted. \u201cBy the time the nonsense is revealed as such, and enough people know why it is nonsense, the discussion has moved on and new nonsense appears.\u201d In November 2018, the Charity Commission told the IEA to take down Singham\u2019s Plan A+ for being too politically biased. This year, it was republished, with 3,184 revisions to the original document. Meanwhile, Singham continues to work with ministers and the ERG through his private consultancy, Competere, and another new thinktank. Ruparel, the former special adviser to the prime minister on Europe, recalled having to analyse all the thinktank proposals with officials that autumn to brief the prime minister on them. He had worked for an Atlas thinktank partner, Open Europe, \u201ccommenting on the game from the sidelines\u201d, before becoming a special adviser to Davis in 2016, and later to May. In government, he told us, actually trying to deliver practical policies was easier said than done. He said the ERG blitz was stressful but that its proposals had \u201czero impact\u201d on negotiations under May in the end. \u201cIt was all stuff we\u2019d looked at before and dismissed because it was non-negotiable with the EU,\u201d he told us. But did it shift the tide of opinion against the prime minister? \u201cDid these ideas start the political pressure on Mrs May or was the pressure there and politicians picked up these thinktank ideas to make their point? It\u2019s a judgment call,\u201d he said. According to the senior Whitehall source: \u201cIt was a pretty unsettling time. We were very conscious some ministers had bought in to this stuff and you were in between two very strongly held ideological positions, one of them supported by thinktank people who had the ability to turn out papers very fast. It didn\u2019t make life easy. But despite an awful lot of ink being spilt and lots and lots of meetings, they never came up with an answer that sorted out the Irish border. There was a gap between the ideologically driven wish and the hard reality.\u201d * * * One striking thing, talking to current and former Conservative MPs, is how little they seem to know about the influence of key thinktanks in the Atlas Network. Anna Soubry, the former Conservative minister and advocate of a second referendum, acknowledged to us that the ERG\u2019s sustained campaign of media events in autumn 2018 had been \u201chugely significant\u201d, but she was not aware of the thinktank work behind it. \u201cThe clique that think about Europe and nothing else now dominate every aspect of the party,\u201d said Margot James, the former Conservative digital and culture minister. \u201cIt\u2019s just different to the one I joined.\u201d When James entered parliament in 2010, she became a member of the Free Enterprise Group and went to IEA events, but eventually found the thinktank\u2019s views too rigidly ideological. James now feels that a number of MPs have adopted the IEA\u2019s ideas \u201clock, stock and barrel\u201d and that Johnson had surrounded himself with \u201cdogmatic small-state\u201d conservatives. \u201cOh, there are people at No 10 who would honestly make your hair stand on end,\u201d she said. Amid the febrile political atmosphere post-referendum, some remainers have seized upon the personal and organisational connections linking the many Atlas thinktanks. The Labour and Green parties have accused anonymous donors of failing to identify their real agenda, and of using these organisations to undermine British democracy; the Brexit referendum was never presented to the electorate as a way to return to unfettered globalisation, they argue. The thinktanks have also been accused of allowing undeclared donors to influence their research. All of these allegations have been vigorously denied. After the referendum, Elliott, the former Vote Leave director, became a fellow of the Legatum Institute for a period, researching populism and going on a speaking tour of the US. He visited \u201cold friends\u201d at the Heritage Foundation and four other Atlas Network thinktanks to share lessons from the victorious campaign and to make the case for Brexit as a great opportunity for the US-UK trade. He also became an Atlas Network mentor. As far as he is concerned, the Atlas Network had nothing to do with the Brexit campaign. He told us he was bemused by the \u201cspider diagrams\u201d drawn by leftwing campaign groups that link Brexit to the influence of undeclared thinktank funders in the UK and the US. \u201cIt\u2019s verging on conspiracy theory,\u201d he said. His view is that the result of the Brexit referendum came as such a shock to many remainers that they are desperate to find any alternative explanation rather than accept the fact that the British public wanted to leave the EU. Last year, investigators from Greenpeace\u2019s Unearthed journalism team covertly recorded the head of yet another US Atlas thinktank, the E Foundation For Oklahoma, saying his group was planning to raise money to give to the IEA to campaign on Brexit. Littlewood, the IEA\u2019s director, boasted on film that he was \u201cin the Brexit influencing game\u201d, and said he had completed a lucrative tour of US donors. When the footage was published, the IEA denied that it had received any cash from US businesses in relation to its work on trade and Brexit, and stated that it did not recognise the sums of money being suggested by the E Foundation. In recent years, US Atlas partners, under sustained criticism over their funding, have become more transparent in listing many of their donors. By trawling their annual accounts, US tax returns, and grant databases from US foundations, it is possible to identify some of the major donors to US Atlas thinktanks that have hosted prominent British Brexiters or teamed up with them to produce material. Foundations associated with the Koch brothers have been major funders of the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, the American Enterprise Institute, the Manhattan Institute, the Mercatus Center, and the Competitive Enterprise Institute. These same thinktanks have also received funding variously from other foundations connected to US plutocrats, including the ultra-conservative Bradley, Scaife and John Templeton foundations. The family foundation of hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer has been a major donor to the Heritage Foundation and the Cato Institute. The Atlas Network, as an umbrella organisation, has also received multimillion-dollar funding for its worldwide activity in recent years from foundations set up by the Koch, Scaife, Bradley, Earhart and Templeton families. It lists those who give it money in its annual accounts, but only declares its own grants and donations to other organisations in Europe as a whole, making it impossible to see how much it has donated or passed on to specific UK partners. It told us that it had not funded any Brexit-focused projects in the UK. UK thinktanks in the Atlas Network mostly do not identify their donors. They argue that donors, whether British or foreign, have a right to privacy. It is also the case that some private funders and corporations have declared donations themselves, and these have been acknowledged by the thinktanks on their websites, while some donors have been revealed by journalists. In the past two decades, a series of tax-efficient vehicles for US donors have been developed, which make it possible to route money to Atlas thinktanks in the UK. These have raised more than $6m (\u00a34.6m) for rightwing British thinktanks since 2014. New Guardian analysis has identified 11 donors who have given nearly $4m in the past five years. Hannan and the IEA are unimpressed by the left\u2019s criticism of thinktanks\u2019 funding and supposed impact. \u201cA lot of the critique of these supposedly influential groups is based on the idea that if you establish that a libertarian is speaking in a libertarian thinktank, your work is done,\u201d said Hannan. \u201cBut if you take the view that we should have pluralist debate, what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d He pointed out that the Hungarian-American billionaire investor George Soros has funded the pro-EU cause. (Grants awarded by Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations are listed on its website.) Hannan\u2019s own thinktank, the IFT, does not identify its funders, but he defended the right of the super-rich to use their money to help shape politics. \u201cIt would be a regressive thing if people who succeeded in life, whether it\u2019s the Kochs or anyone else, thought they should spend money on themselves rather than on things they believed in. Of course you would expect people to be spreading their ideas,\u201d he said. Besides, he argued, in the marketplace of ideas, even vast sums of money cannot magically turn bad ideas into persuasive ones. In the end, he reckoned: \u201cThe best ideas win. That\u2019s how it works, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

How could it be? As a nation built, in no small part, on slavery and colonialism, it has long infected our culture and institutions. And since politics emerges from that culture, is embedded in those institutions and involves distributing resources and power, it could never be immune. It is not just a matter of individuals with bad ideas, but a system of oppression that does bad things. All parties navigate it \u2013 you can\u2019t be on the ballot and not be in society.</p> <p>For those who imagined that electoral politics offered a clear moral choice between parties untainted by racism, the last week would come as a particular shock. It certainly seemed to throw ITV\u2019s political editor, Robert Peston, in his response to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/25/labour-has-let-poison-of-antisemitism-take-root-says-chief-rabbi\" title=\"\">the chief rabbi\u2019s</a> statement that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s handling of antisemitism made him unfit for office. \u201cI am not making any kind of political statement here,\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Peston/status/1199100651642507270\" title=\"\">tweeted</a>. \u201cWhat I am saying is our democracy has traditionally been a beacon of tolerance and understanding.\u201d Peston argues not only from a position of absolute ignorance but relative privilege.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s difficult to see what meaningful conversation you can have about racism in British politics that does not involve the Windrush scandal</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is, of course, a very political statement from him. The fact that a political editor believes it is not is itself revealing. It seeks to take racism out of the realm of politics and into the domain of decency and fair play. Looking beyond politics to the coarse discourse below, he sets himself above it all and bigotry beneath us all.</p> <p>Racism doesn\u2019t work like that. It is not a metaphor \u2013 a symbol for incompetence, boorishness, impoliteness or stupidity. Nor is it a state of mind \u2013 a deficiency of the soul, heart, intellect, emotion or spirit. Racism is a systemic form of discrimination, with a centuries-old legacy, that shapes lived experience today. As such, it cannot be weaponised because it is already a weapon. As well as denying people employment, housing, education, equality, human rights, safety and opportunity, it can literally kill.</p> <p>Racism can, however, be deployed. It may galvanise, distract, deflect, distort, scapegoat and marginalise. It is an incredibly effective tool for dividing people and giving a sense of superiority to those to whom you have nothing material to offer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88a4addc245516c1a2d83d571ad56c24eb0554e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88a4addc245516c1a2d83d571ad56c24eb0554e8/0_116_1912_1147/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson: \u2018When it comes to combating prejudice, people expect more from Labour; they expect nothing from Conservatives.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WPA Pool/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fact that it has blighted both parties does not mean they are equally as bad. Labour has, historically, been most likely to identify with movements that opposed racism \u2013 even if it has not always lived up to its promise \u2013 and to pass laws that supported equality. That is what makes the moment so distressing. When it comes to combating prejudice, people expect more from Labour; they expect nothing from Conservatives.</p> <p>Nor does it mean that nothing can be done about it. The racism that exists in politics can only be eradicated through politics. At any given moment there are potential allies and opportunities to force institutions to meet their historic and stated ends. Trade unions were once the principal obstacle to non-white people being hired in some sectors in this country. Minorities did not abandon unions. They faced them down, fought them from the inside and turned many of them into effective bulwarks against racism. The issue is whether the organisation in question is fit for purpose.</p> <p>The aim here is not to change the subject from antisemitism and Labour, but to broaden our understanding of it and, in so doing, deepen our capacity to resist it. It is, of course, possible to discuss antisemitism in Labour on its own terms. It is not necessary to deflect attention from it, minimise it, deny it or debate it. The presence of an element of the left that is susceptible to antisemitic conspiracy theories, and anxiety among Jews that those views are being tolerated and even encouraged, are both real.</p> <p>It should also be possible to discuss it in relation to antisemitism elsewhere and to racism of other forms. Indeed, it is important to do so lest it is rendered an abstraction \u2013 examined as an isolated and particularised case of prejudice in the polity that afflicts one party and one minority, rather than a longstanding challenge to a part of our politics and culture that affects many minorities and all parties.</p> <p>To talk about Islamophobia in this context is not \u201cwhataboutery\u201d. Half of all <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45874265\" title=\"\">religious hate crimes</a> in England and Wales are directed against Muslims, the religious group most disproportionately underrepresented in parliament and overrepresented among the poor. The Tory party\u2019s record on Muslims is appalling and it has no intention of addressing it specifically. It\u2019s difficult to see what meaningful conversation you can have about racism in British politics that does not involve the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/audio/2019/nov/22/windrush-the-scandal-isnt-over\" title=\"\">Windrush scandal</a>, which saw British citizens forced out of jobs, denied housing and health care, deported, or threatened with deportation by a knowingly callous government. The only way in which issues like this become irrelevant is if you seriously think that a \u201cbeacon of tolerance and understanding\u201d has only now been extinguished.</p> <p>It\u2019s an election. We have to make a choice. If \u201cthe soul of our nation\u201d really is at stake then these too are factors in that choice.</p> <p>It is possible to keep more than one idea in your head at the same time. Indeed, it is necessary because those who would seek to divide us would love us to remain in ethnic silos, arguing about who has it worse \u2013 rather than uniting to make it better for everyone.</p> <p>\u2022 Gary Younge is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "As Labour foreign secretary in 1951, Herbert Morrison described independence for African colonies as comparable to giving a child of 10 \u201ca latchkey, a bank account and a shotgun\u201d. In 1955, Winston Churchill told his cabinet he wanted to fight the general election on the slogan: \u201cKeep England White.\u201d In 1964, in Smethwick, West Midlands, a Tory candidate bucked the national trend to win with a campaign slogan: \u201cIf you want a nigger for a neighbour vote Labour.\u201d In 1968, Enoch Powell warned there would \u201crivers of blood\u201d if non-white immigration were not halted. In 1978, Margaret Thatcher referred to Britain being \u201cswamped by people with a different culture\u201d \u2013 a phrase repeated by David Blunkett in 2002 in reference to asylum seekers\u2019 children in schools. In 1990 three Liberal Democrats in Tower Hamlets were expelled from the party after distributing a fake Labour leaflet alleging Labour would rehouse homeless Bangladeshis. In 2004, the agent in a byelection campaign, chaired by Tom Watson, emailed the candidate, Phil Woolas, and his campaign manager: \u201cIf we don\u2019t get the white vote angry he\u2019s gone.\u201d When a court ruled that Woolas had breached election law by making false statements he received messages of support from both Gordon Brown and Cherie Blair. In 2009, the British National party won two seats in the European parliament. In 2014, Nigel Farage, then the leader of Ukip, said \u201cthe basic principle\u201d of Powell\u2019s rivers of blood speech was \u201ccorrect\u201d: his party topped the poll in the European elections later that year. The current prime minister has refused to apologise for referring to black people as \u201cpiccaninnies\u201d with \u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d and Muslim women as letterboxes. A single black MP, Diane Abbott, receives half of all the online abuse sent to female MPs. Racism is not new to British politics. How could it be? As a nation built, in no small part, on slavery and colonialism, it has long infected our culture and institutions. And since politics emerges from that culture, is embedded in those institutions and involves distributing resources and power, it could never be immune. It is not just a matter of individuals with bad ideas, but a system of oppression that does bad things. All parties navigate it \u2013 you can\u2019t be on the ballot and not be in society. For those who imagined that electoral politics offered a clear moral choice between parties untainted by racism, the last week would come as a particular shock. It certainly seemed to throw ITV\u2019s political editor, Robert Peston, in his response to the chief rabbi\u2019s statement that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s handling of antisemitism made him unfit for office. \u201cI am not making any kind of political statement here,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cWhat I am saying is our democracy has traditionally been a beacon of tolerance and understanding.\u201d Peston argues not only from a position of absolute ignorance but relative privilege. This is, of course, a very political statement from him. The fact that a political editor believes it is not is itself revealing. It seeks to take racism out of the realm of politics and into the domain of decency and fair play. Looking beyond politics to the coarse discourse below, he sets himself above it all and bigotry beneath us all. Racism doesn\u2019t work like that. It is not a metaphor \u2013 a symbol for incompetence, boorishness, impoliteness or stupidity. Nor is it a state of mind \u2013 a deficiency of the soul, heart, intellect, emotion or spirit. Racism is a systemic form of discrimination, with a centuries-old legacy, that shapes lived experience today. As such, it cannot be weaponised because it is already a weapon. As well as denying people employment, housing, education, equality, human rights, safety and opportunity, it can literally kill. Racism can, however, be deployed. It may galvanise, distract, deflect, distort, scapegoat and marginalise. It is an incredibly effective tool for dividing people and giving a sense of superiority to those to whom you have nothing material to offer. The fact that it has blighted both parties does not mean they are equally as bad. Labour has, historically, been most likely to identify with movements that opposed racism \u2013 even if it has not always lived up to its promise \u2013 and to pass laws that supported equality. That is what makes the moment so distressing. When it comes to combating prejudice, people expect more from Labour; they expect nothing from Conservatives. Nor does it mean that nothing can be done about it. The racism that exists in politics can only be eradicated through politics. At any given moment there are potential allies and opportunities to force institutions to meet their historic and stated ends. Trade unions were once the principal obstacle to non-white people being hired in some sectors in this country. Minorities did not abandon unions. They faced them down, fought them from the inside and turned many of them into effective bulwarks against racism. The issue is whether the organisation in question is fit for purpose. The aim here is not to change the subject from antisemitism and Labour, but to broaden our understanding of it and, in so doing, deepen our capacity to resist it. It is, of course, possible to discuss antisemitism in Labour on its own terms. It is not necessary to deflect attention from it, minimise it, deny it or debate it. The presence of an element of the left that is susceptible to antisemitic conspiracy theories, and anxiety among Jews that those views are being tolerated and even encouraged, are both real. It should also be possible to discuss it in relation to antisemitism elsewhere and to racism of other forms. Indeed, it is important to do so lest it is rendered an abstraction \u2013 examined as an isolated and particularised case of prejudice in the polity that afflicts one party and one minority, rather than a longstanding challenge to a part of our politics and culture that affects many minorities and all parties. To talk about Islamophobia in this context is not \u201cwhataboutery\u201d. Half of all religious hate crimes in England and Wales are directed against Muslims, the religious group most disproportionately underrepresented in parliament and overrepresented among the poor. The Tory party\u2019s record on Muslims is appalling and it has no intention of addressing it specifically. It\u2019s difficult to see what meaningful conversation you can have about racism in British politics that does not involve the Windrush scandal, which saw British citizens forced out of jobs, denied housing and health care, deported, or threatened with deportation by a knowingly callous government. The only way in which issues like this become irrelevant is if you seriously think that a \u201cbeacon of tolerance and understanding\u201d has only now been extinguished. It\u2019s an election. We have to make a choice. If \u201cthe soul of our nation\u201d really is at stake then these too are factors in that choice. It is possible to keep more than one idea in your head at the same time. Indeed, it is necessary because those who would seek to divide us would love us to remain in ethnic silos, arguing about who has it worse \u2013 rather than uniting to make it better for everyone. \u2022 Gary Younge is a Guardian columnist",

Of that, only 820 hectares was planted annually by Forest Enterprise, the government-funded forestry agency, and the rest by private companies or charities. </p> \n  <p>The overall target was met for the first time last year, when 11,200 hectares were planted. </p> \n  <p>Sturgeon\u2019s government has agreed to greatly increase tree planting in line with recommendations from the UK committee on climate change, which says Scotland can reach net zero five years early than the UK as a whole partly because it has much greater scope for tree planting.

We don\u2019t have to destroy the countryside with fracking. We don\u2019t have to carry on in this way. Labour\u2019s manifesto sets out large green transformation fund.

We can change everyone\u2019s boilers to a heat pump, but only if we insulate first. </p> \n  <p><strong>Sturgeon:</strong> We must prioritise transport and heat. We in Scotland already have a home energy efficiency programme. Already put hundreds of millions into helping people insulate their homes. Some people will have to pay, but government has a big part to play. Scotland cannot de-carbonise the gas grid on its own. Transition away from fossil fuels must accelerate. If we were to stop oil production tomorrow we would make ourselves more reliant on imports. We must also focus on the justice of transition - can\u2019t do this in a way that leaves people behind and decimates peoples\u2019 jobs. The legacy of deindustrialisation is still there and we can\u2019t make the same mistake.</p> \n  <p><strong>Price:</strong> Wales can be there at the start of this new industrial revolution if we tap into that potential.

There have been reports saying that the party\u2019s private polling shows it is vulnerable in leave seats but - as ever - private polling mostly replicates the results of polling that gets released to the public, and the YouGov survey highlighted this exact point. Here is an extract form <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/11/27/yougov-mrp-conservatives-359-labour-211-snp-43-ld-\">the write-up </a>from YouGov\u2019s <strong>Anthony Wells</strong>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If the election were held today we project that the Tories would win 359 seats (a gain of 42 from 2017), Labour would win 211 (down by 51), the SNP 43 (up eight) and the Liberal Democrats 13 (a gain of one). Plaid Cymru would retain their four seats, the Greens would keep their single seat, and the Brexit party would not take any seats at all.</p> \n   <p>As it stands, the swing to the Conservative party is bigger in areas that voted to leave in 2016, with the bulk of the projected Tory gains coming in the North and the urban West Midlands, as well as former mining seats in the East Midlands.</p> \n   <p>At this point in the campaign, the Liberal Democrats have not made any real breakthrough \u2013 with our current projections showing that while they would pick up four seats they would lose three elsewhere.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The survey has been acquired near-gospel status in the Westminster political system because in 2017 the YouGov MRP (multilevel regression and post-stratification) model (explained <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/11/27/how-yougovs-2019-general-election-model-works\">here</a>, if you are interested) was about the one polling exercise that predicted a hung parliament.

The Ipsos Mori poll for STV has more grim news for Labour, putting its support at 16%.</p> \n  <p>The Ipsos poll also found the Conservatives have secured 26% of the vote, consistent with other recent polls, while the Liberal Democrats have failed to capitalise on Scotland\u2019s strong pro-European sentiment, polling at just 11%.</p> \n  <p>Only six months after the Brexit party won a Scottish seat in the European parliament with 14.8% of the vote, Ipsos found its support in Scotland now too low to be effectively measured: it puts it at under 1%.</p> \n  <p>The Ipsos poll, one of the few done by random telephone surveys, has a chink of light for Labour and the Lib Dems. It said 23% of the 1,046 voters it polled last week have yet to make up their mind. While 84% of Tory and SNP voters have decided, only 73% of Labour supporters and 66% of Lib Dems were sure which way they would vote.</p> \n  <p>Even so, it suggests recent polls forecasting another dire election for Scottish Labour are correct.</p> \n  <p>Yesterday\u2019s YouGov poll for the Times predicted Labour will only retain two of its seven seats, in Edinburgh South and Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill. Others say Labour can only save Edinburgh South, a seat held by the Scottish party\u2019s most vehement critic of Jeremy Corbyn, Ian Murray.</p> \n  <p>Ipsos asked respondents to spontaneously list the most important topics for them at the election: 72% of Tories and 79% of Lib Dems put Brexit first; 67% of Labour voters prioritised the NHS, followed by Brexit, and 55% of SNP voters put Brexit first, with 46% mentioning independence and 45% the NHS.</p> \n  <p>It said Sturgeon was the only party leader not to have a negative satisfaction rating, but voters were split 48% to 48% on whether she was doing a good or bad job. Boris Johnson had a net satisfaction rating of -52, with 23% of Tory voters disliking him, while Jeremy Corbyn was -47, with 41% of Labour voters dissatisfied with him.</p> \n  <p>Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, appears to be less unpopular in Scotland than other UK polls suggest. While 25% of voters had no opinion of her, her net satisfaction rating was the best of the UK leaders at -21%.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e29e5b00c9cddf0c190b6564fdd9fcb00310281\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e29e5b00c9cddf0c190b6564fdd9fcb00310281/0_282_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicola Sturgeon at the SNP manifesto launch yesterday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicola Sturgeon at the SNP manifesto launch yesterday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Perry/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ddfc1438f08dcf251b4ab3b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-28T12:45:18.013Z\">12.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"643b3057a6bfa930d1523f77c0e420231f9d8608\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/643b3057a6bfa930d1523f77c0e420231f9d8608/0_88_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson watching students Ruby Culter and Matthew Upright performing a science experiment during his visit to Chulmleigh College in Devon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson watching students Ruby Culter and Matthew Upright performing a science experiment during his visit to Chulmleigh College in Devon.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: POOL/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ddfb80c8f087410d9874570\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-28T12:15:41.727Z\">12.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q: The IFS says some of the Waspi women who will benefit from your \u00a358bn compensation are quite well off.

Little in the way of changes to tax, spending, welfare or anything else. Yes, there are some spending increases for health and education already promised, but essentially nothing new in the manifesto.</p> \n   <p>Labour, by contrast, want to change everything. Their vision is of a state with a far greater role than anything we have seen for more than 40 years. They would tax and spend more than ever before, putting in place a new universal welfare state with free childcare, free university, free personal care, free prescriptions and more besides; they would impose a swathe of new labour market regulations; their minimum wage would directly set the wages of a quarter of private sector workers; they would nationalise a series of companies whose performance is of vital importance to the UK economy; they would enforce transfer of effective ownership of 10% of large companies from current owners to a combination of employees and government. For good or bad five years of Labour government would involve enormous economic and social change.</p> \n   <p>In the face of such vast ambition from Labour, one should not forget that the Liberal Democrat manifesto is itself a radical document that would involve a decisive move away from the policies of the past decade.</p> \n   <p>Rarely can a starker choice have been placed before the UK electorate.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ddf9a5b8f08cd6fe586d492\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-28T10:00:32.583Z\">10.00am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Labour and Tories both not 'being honest with electorate' over tax, says IFS</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is more from <strong>Paul Johnson</strong>\u2019s opening presentation at the Institute for Fiscal Studies\u2019 briefing.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>All other countries which tax and spend on the scale that Labour proposes have tax systems which levy more tax on the average worker than we do.

      "bodyText": "Party leaders took part in Channel 4\u2019s climate debate, while Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage refused to attend. With Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage refusing to take part (and getting replaced by melting ice sculptures), the leaders of the Greens, Lib Dems, SNP, Plaid Cymru and Labour took part in a relatively straightforward debate. While there were some barbs over the records of the Lib Dems, SNP and Labour in government, the debate mostly focused on how each party would out-bid the other in the fight against climate change. You can read the Guardian\u2019s analysis of the event here. Conservatives and Channel 4 row: Tories threaten Channel 4 after it replaced Boris Johnson with an ice sculpture . In an ongoing and worsening row between the Conservative party and Channel 4 News, the Tories have threatened to review the channel\u2019s broadcasting remit after it replaced Boris Johnson with a melting ice sculpture following his failure to attend the leaders\u2019 climate debate. Channel 4 News editor Ben de Pear then took to Twitter to accuse the Conservative party of behaving like Donald Trump, following Tory party chairman James Cleverly claiming that \u201cthis is not a presidential election\u201d. Read the full story from the Guardian\u2019s media editor Jim Waterson here. Michael Gove attempts to attend the leaders\u2019 debate on behalf of the Conservatives, and gets confronted by a 15-year-old climate activist. Michael Gove and the prime minister\u2019s father, Stanley Johnson, turned up at the Channel 4 climate debate to ask if Gove could speak on behalf of the Conservatives. The broadcaster declined, as the debate was for party leaders only. Gove was also confronted by 15-year-old climate activist Izzy Warren, who challenged him on the Tories\u2019 record on the environment in government. SNP suspends election candidate over alleged anti-Semitism. Neale Hanvey, who was set to contest the marginal seat of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath currently held by Labour, has been stripped of his candidacy and suspended from the party. BBC demands the Tories take down a Facebook ad featuring its presenters, arguing that the footage could damage the perception of impartiality. The paid-for advert uses selective footage of the BBC\u2019s political editor Laura Kuenssberg and News at Ten host Huw Edwards to argue that chaotic debates over Brexit can be avoided if people vote Conservative. The BBC said its footage had been used without permission and asked the Conservatives to stop using the material in this manner. Labour to launch regional manifestos in England under plans to hand \u2018wealth and power back to every community\u2019, which include several pledges on housing, transport and green jobs Tory HQ warns party\u2019s supporters against election complacency following predictions that Boris Johnson will reap a comfortable majority. \u201cIf the polls are wrong by a few points, and they have been wrong before, we end up with a hung parliament. Our team know that, and now we have to convince the public. There should be no complacency or let-up or change of direction. We will continue with our central messages: get Brexit done, more hospitals, more nurses, more police,\u201d a senior party source said. That\u2019s all from me tonight. Labour will launch a manifesto in every region of England under plans to hand \u201cwealth and power back to every community\u201d. The manifestos will include pledges on transport, housing and jobs. The manifestos will be launched alongside further details of the party\u2019s \u00a3250bn Green Transformation Fund, which the party said is an \u201cinvestment blitz\u201d on a scale unseen since the Second World War. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the announcement will \u201cbring our country back together\u201d. The pledges include a number of transport projects, such as: Northern Powerhouse Rail - improving connections between Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Hull, and Newcastle, and cutting journey times Investment in the Midlands Mainline railway Electrification of lines around Bristol Temple Meads There are also several pledges on green jobs, including: Three new steel recycling plants in Redcar, Workington and Corby, which Labour says will create over 1,000 jobs in each town Nine plastics remanufacture and recycling sites - one for each region Three electric vehicle battery plants in Stoke, Swindon and South Wales - creating 5,000 jobs in each location Investment in green energy manufacturing supply chains for eight ports Emma Barnett grills Lib Dem deputy leader Ed Davey on the \u201ctoxicity\u201d associated with Jo Swinson\u2019s record in government with the Conservatives, and who the Lib Dems could realistically support to be prime minister. On whether the Lib Dems underestimated the \u201ctoxicity\u201d associated with Swinson\u2019s role in the coalition government, Davey said that she is \u201cgoing down really well in the seats that we need\u201d. Admitting that it is \u201cunlikely\u201d the Lib Dems win a majority, he refused to answer who the party could plausibly support as prime minister. \u201cYou will get Liberal Democrat MPs voting issue by issue,\u201d he said, adding that the Lib Dems would not support Jeremy Corbyn or Boris Johnson. He added that he believes there will be \u201ca lot\u201d of parliamentary movement following the next election, and that the parties may change leader. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t looking for a bowel movement, they\u2019re looking for a prime minister,\u201d Barnett responded. Emma Barnett asks Labour\u2019s Lucy Powell on BBC Newsnight how she would campaign in a confirmatory referendum - something that is in Labour\u2019s Brexit policy. Powell said that she will \u201cprobably vote remain\u201d, but thinks \u201cwe are some way off that\u201d. She added that she has spent the last few months \u201ctrying to get a compromise deal through parliament\u201d as she believed it was \u201cthe best way of bringing the country together\u201d. This comes after Labour\u2019s Clive Lewis was unable to say what percentage of the shadow cabinet would campaign to remain. Emma Barnett asks Charles Walker, vice-chair of the Conservative\u2019s 1922 Committee, what the prime minister is afraid of, in reference to his refusal to attend several televised debates between party leaders and his failure to secure an interview date with Andrew Neil. \u201cIf you ask me, I wouldn\u2019t do Andrew Neil,\u201d Walker responded. Emma Barnett rebuts: \u201cAndrew Neil isn\u2019t a criminal, he\u2019s a journalist.\u201d Walker continues: \u201cBoris will do what he wants to do. He is the prime minister.\u201d He later adds that if he himself were to be interviewed by Neil, Neil would tear him \u201cto pieces\u201d. Emma Barnett responds: \u201cLet\u2019s not demonise journalists, shall we?\u201d Labour\u2019s shadow treasury minister Clive Lewis tells BBC Newsnight that he couldn\u2019t say what percentage of the shadow cabinet would campaign for remain in the instance of a second referendum. Krishnan Guru-Murthy has now taken to Twitter to respond to Michael Gove\u2019s claim that Jeremy Corbyn and Nicola Sturgeon refused to debate a Conservative, in an ongoing row between Channel 4 News and the Conservative party: The Twitter spat between the Conservatives and Ben de Pear, the editor of Channel 4 News, continues: Labour\u2019s Deputy Leader Tom Watson says it is \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d for Boris Johnson to threaten Channel 4 with its public service broadcasting licence for replacing him with an ice sculpture when he failed to turn up to tonight\u2019s climate debate. Tom Watson has written to Ofcom to urge the regulator to \u201ccall out this meddling\u201d. His letter adds: \u201cBoris Johnson has banned the Daily Mirror from its battle bus, ducked the Andrew Neil interview and now attempted to bully Channel 4. \u201cIt\u2019s simple. If the Prime Minister didn\u2019t want to be embarrassed by being replaced with an ice sculpture, he should have turned up to the debate. \u201cThe truth is, Boris Johnson is in hiding because his record of failure on the climate emergency is indefensible.\u201d The campaign group Grime4Corbyn has claimed a Conservative win at the general election could lead to people \u201cdying from austerity cuts\u201d and \u201cfreezing to death in their homes\u201d. Co-organiser Sofia Mason, 34, described the Tory party as \u201cracist and harmful for our communities\u201d and urged voters to opt for Labour in December. The Grime 4 Corbyn campaign group was inspired by grime artists expressing their support for the Labour leader at the 2017 election, and works with musicians to put on events. More on the story of the SNP candidate for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, Neale Hanvey, who was stripped of his candidacy following alleged antisemitism: In a statement issued via his Twitter account, Hanvey issued an \u201cunequivocal apology\u201d for posting two items which he now realised were offensive and inappropriate. He said he fully supported the SNP\u2019s decision to remove him as its candidate and suspend his party membership pending investigation. He confirmed one was a Sputnik article which pictured Soros holding two world leaders as puppets, but did not realise that was an antisemitic trope. \u201cI did not give any thought to Mr Soros\u2019s faith. [I] fully accept that this was wrong,\u201d Hanvey said. The second post drew parallels between the treatment of Palestinians today with the \u201cunconscionable\u201d treatment of Jews in Europe during the second world war. \u201cThis was insensitive, upsetting and deeply offensive\u201d, Hanvey said. Both posts were \u201cdreadful errors of judgment,\u201d he said. \u201cI accept there may not be the words to express my regret for those I have offended but I am genuinely and deeply sorry.\u201d The BBC is demanding the Conservatives take down Facebook adverts featuring footage of its journalists Laura Kuenssberg and Huw Edwards, arguing that their inclusion could damage perceptions of the corporation\u2019s impartiality. The paid-for advert uses footage of the BBC\u2019s political editor and the News at Ten host to argue that chaotic debates over Brexit can be avoided if people vote Conservative. The move is in common with other intentionally provocative stunts pulled by the Conservatives during this campaign, such as rebranding their press office Twitter account as a fact checker. Read more from the Guardian\u2019s media editor, Jim Waterson, below: 15-year-old Izzy Warren, the climate change activist from West London who confronted Michael Gove as he arrived at Channel 4 earlier, has spoken to the Guardian. \u201cI just saw a really good opportunity to find out why Boris Johnson, the current prime minister, doesn\u2019t view my generation\u2019s future as a priority, why he doesn\u2019t think it deserves his time,\u201d she said. \u201cI asked Gove why, if the Conservatives think this is a priority, the prime minister wasn\u2019t here today,\u201d said Warren. He told her that it shouldn\u2019t matter who was there to speak and that they had the most ambitious manifesto ever on climate change. \u201cThis is a party that has been in power for ten years and we haven\u2019t seen climate action,\u201d she said. Asked if he looked surprised, she added: \u201cI think older men, quite frankly, aren\u2019t used to being challenged by teenage girls. Which makes it all the more fun when you get to do it.\u201d Here is video footage of Michael Gove getting confronted by Warren outside the Channel 4 studios in London: Green party deputy leader, Amelia Womack, echoed Gruffydd\u2019s frustration with the main parties. Speaking backstage, she said that it was frustrating to see parties who had been in government and opposition and who had previously taken no action, \u201cfeeling the time is now\u201d to say it is their priority. She acknowledged that it was a welcome development that there was a TV debate on the subject. \u201cIt was only 2017 when [Green MP] Caroline Lucas was walking around Westminster with a big green question mark asking where the environment was in the public debate and just a few years later it\u2019s become a central topic that parties are going to get held to account for.\u201d Llyr Gruffydd, a Plaid Cymru Welsh assembly member for north Wales, was watching the debate from backstage. \u201cIt always riles me to hear Jeremy Corbyn making these promises when we\u2019ve had twenty years of Labour governments in Wales,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are getting away with that all the time. In places where they have the power to affect that change, we\u2019re just not seeing it.\u201d He repeated criticism by the party\u2019s leader Adam Price of Labour\u2019s plans to nationalise the gas grid. \u201cThey are going to pump tens of billions of pounds into buying infrastructure that they are effectively going to mothball and that\u2019s money that they could actually invest in renewable energy. That\u2019s questionable.\u201d Gruffydd described the suggestion that Channel 4 had conspired with Jeremy Corbyn to block the Conservatives from the debate as nonsense. \u201cIt\u2019s so Cummings-eque,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly the kind of thing we\u2019ve learned to expect from the Tories. If they can\u2019t engage in the debate then it\u2019s toys and prams stuff.\u201d Conservative party chairman James Cleverly and Channel 4 News editor Ben de Pear have shared a frank exchange of opinion on Twitter: A Conservative party spokesperson has accused Channel 4 of bias. \u201cWe are deeply disappointed that Channel 4 News has conspired with Jeremy Corbyn to block the Conservatives from making the case for tackling climate change and protecting the environment in this evening\u2019s debate,\u201d they said. \u201cUnder this Government the UK was the first advanced economy in the world to legislate for a net zero target and we\u2019ve reduced emissions faster than any other advanced economy while continuing to grow our economy. Broadcasters have important responsibilities to present a balanced debate representing all parties, and Michael Gove was well qualified to represent the Conservative position at this evening\u2019s debate.\u201d Michael Gove was turned away from the debate, which was for party leaders only, after Boris Johnson refused to attend. The Conservatives are now threatening to review the channel\u2019s broadcasting remit after it decided to replace Boris Johnson with a melting ice sculpture during the debate. This from Holly Gillibrand, a 14-year-old FridaysForFuture activist in Scotland on the climate debate: Michael Gove, who attempted to replace Boris Johnson in the Channel 4 climate debate, was confronted at the channel\u2019s London studios by a 15-year-old climate activist. As he was turned away from the debate after being told it was for party leaders only, he was confronted by Izzy Warren, who lambasted the prime minister\u2019s failure to attend. She told him: \u201cWhat young people think is Boris Johnson\u2019s showing up to discuss Brexit, he\u2019s showing up to discuss all these other issues. \u201cAnd actually he\u2019s not here to talk about the climate. He\u2019s not here to talk about what is ultimately the most pressing issue.\u201d Michael Gove - a former environment secretary - replied: \u201cI\u2019m here. I can talk about it.\u201d You can watch the exchange in full below: An update on the attempt by the Conservative party to have Michael Gove take Boris Johnson\u2019s place in the Channel 4 leaders\u2019 climate debate, which was rejected: Watching the debate in \u201cthe spin room\u201d the prime minister\u2019s father, Stanley Johnson, insisted that Gove had been \u201cabsolutely geared up to represent the Conservative party and the prime minister\u201d. \u201cMichael Gove would have made a big, big contribution,\u201d he said, adding that he suspected the other party leaders had realised that the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster \u201cwould have wiped the floor with them\u201d. Moving away from the climate debate, the SNP candidate for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, a key SNP target seat defended by Corbyn ally Lesley Laird, has been stripped of his candidacy over alleged anti-Semitism. Neale Hanvey, who was widely expected to win the seat, has been stripped of his candidacy and suspended from the party pending disciplinary action. Read the full story from our Scotland editor, Severin Carrell, here: Channel 4 News presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy said the invitation for Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage to come and debate the climate emergency \u201cremains open\u201d. In concluding the climate debate, Mr Guru-Murthy said: \u201cThank you to all our party leaders who came tonight. Thank you also to Michael Gove from the Conservative Party who did come here, but sadly, as we made clear from the start, this debate was for leaders only and our leaders were only prepared to debate other leaders. \u201cOur offer to Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage to come here and discuss the climate emergency remains open.\u201d The Tories have threatened to review Channel 4\u2019s broadcasting remit following the channel\u2019s decision to replace Boris Johnson with a melting ice sculpture during the debate. Asked about his own personal resolution in relation to climate, Corbyn said: \u201cI\u2019m always the last one to turn the heating on. In fact, we turned it on for the first time last week in my house, and that was very low temperature anyway, and I turned it off pretty quickly after that. \u201cI\u2019m quite miserable actually on this basis, because I don\u2019t like to see the waste of energy that goes with it.\u201d Corbyn also said he grows plants in his garden and allotment. Berry was the last leader asked, and she said that so many pledges \u201cend up on a dusty shelf\u201d, adding: \u201cI just cannot sit back and watch this happen again. Greta Thunberg is only a teenager, she\u2019s already sick of hearing broken promises. \u201cThink how I feel at my age.\u201d The leaders were asked what their personal climate change resolutions are. Sturgeon said that at home, her energy provider is one that gets all its energy from renewable sources, adding that she is trying to fly less. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s inescapable in the job that I do, but trying to use the train much more when I come to London, as I did today for example,\u201d she said. Sturgeon also said she is \u201cmuch more conscious\u201d about what she eats and where her food is sourced from. Swinson mentioned a keep cup and recycling, and pointed out that her campaign bus is electric. Price said he plans to start cycling and will shift to an electric vehicle in the new year, adding: \u201cI convinced my partner as well we\u2019re going to give a go with reusable nappies as well to make our own small but important contribution.\u201d Sturgeon said Scotland\u2019s transition away from fossil fuels needs to accelerate. She said: \u201cWe\u2019re in the transition away from fossil fuels, and that transition has to accelerate.\u201d On the need for decarbonisation of the gas grid, Sturgeon added: \u201cThere\u2019s not enough priority being given to that by the current UK government and I hope that changes after the election.\u201d Price also pledged that Plaid Cymru would invest \u00a35bn in retrofitting homes. Factcheck Claim: Jeremy Corbyn is promising to plant 2bn trees by 2040 Reality: The government must already adhere to the Committee for Climate Change target of 1.5bn trees by 2050. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s pledge is for more trees in 20 rather than 30 years. This means 100m trees must be planted a year to expand woodland and make up for losses. This is ambitious, but is not impossible and not out of synch with what experts say. Factcheck Claim: Nicola Sturgeon said that last year 85% of the UK\u2019s tree planting took place in Scotland. Reality: That is correct but the Scottish government has repeatedly failed to meet its national tree-planting targets, set at 10,000 hectares (24,700 acres) a year from 2010. Official data shows that from 2010 to 2017, Scotland\u2019s planting rate averaged 6,800 hectares a year, well below target. Of that, only 820 hectares was planted annually by Forest Enterprise, the government-funded forestry agency, and the rest by private companies or charities. The overall target was met for the first time last year, when 11,200 hectares were planted. Sturgeon\u2019s government has agreed to greatly increase tree planting in line with recommendations from the UK committee on climate change, which says Scotland can reach net zero five years early than the UK as a whole partly because it has much greater scope for tree planting. However, the Scottish government has yet to decide on how to do so. Mr Corbyn said everything possible must be done to reach a 2030 net zero emissions target. The Labour leader said: \u201cI think we have to do everything we can to get to a 2030 net zero emissions target and we do that by investment in green energy jobs, solar, wind and wave power, we do that by creating jobs and transforming our energy consumption, by retrofitting homes to make them environmentally sustainable.\u201d He added: \u201cI want to host COP26 next year to go further than Paris, so we can be leaders on the world stage in setting the agenda of achieving this degree of sustainability by 2030.\u201d Ms Sturgeon added that Scotland\u2019s targets are \u201cthe toughest in the world\u201d and that they are going \u201cbeyond what the Committee on Climate Change has said\u201d. Also calling for the 2030 target, Mr Price said it was a shame that Labour\u2019s manifesto only pledged to get \u201cthe majority\u201d of emissions down by 2030, and called on a future UK government to \u201cshow the same level of ambition\u201d as other countries. Ms Swinson said Liberal Democrats \u201cbelieve it is absolutely possible to get there by 2045\u201d. Factcheck Claim: Si\u00e2n Berry, co-leader of the Green Party claims that pasture land used for meat need to be changed to reach carbon neutrality. Reality: The government\u2019s advisory Committee for Climate Change says a 20-50% reduction in beef and lamb pasture could release 3-7m hectares of grassland from the current 12m hectares in the UK. Plaid Cymru\u2019s Adam Price claimed that this did not mean fewer cattle because grass can bank carbon. But the CCC found that un-needed grassland could instead grow forests and biofuels that would help to soak up CO2. Price said farmers are \u201ccustodians of the environment\u201d, adding that they should be seen as \u201callies\u201d and not \u201cenemies\u201d. He added: \u201cWe need to be buying more locally, we need to create local food systems.\u201d Swinson: We need to make sure that we have a target for all new build homes to be zero carbon. The Conservatives scrapped those plans. We would pay for low income homes to have insulation fitted. Corbyn: We can and do retrofit homes. We don\u2019t have to destroy the countryside with fracking. We don\u2019t have to carry on in this way. Labour\u2019s manifesto sets out large green transformation fund. Social housing will get that done. We will pay for low income houses. Everyone else will be offered an interest-free loan. People will get the benefit of it in lower bills. Berry: Is this realistic? You\u2019ve got to do it in a comprehensive way. More than half of UK emissions are from our buildings and homes. \u201cIt\u2019s not sexy\u201d going around putting insulation in people\u2019s homes so successive governments have ignored it. Of \u00a3100bn a year in our Green New Deal, \u00a338bn needs to go into homes. We need a deeper retrofit than what Labour are proposing. We can change everyone\u2019s boilers to a heat pump, but only if we insulate first. Sturgeon: We must prioritise transport and heat. We in Scotland already have a home energy efficiency programme. Already put hundreds of millions into helping people insulate their homes. Some people will have to pay, but government has a big part to play. Scotland cannot de-carbonise the gas grid on its own. Transition away from fossil fuels must accelerate. If we were to stop oil production tomorrow we would make ourselves more reliant on imports. We must also focus on the justice of transition - can\u2019t do this in a way that leaves people behind and decimates peoples\u2019 jobs. The legacy of deindustrialisation is still there and we can\u2019t make the same mistake. Price: Wales can be there at the start of this new industrial revolution if we tap into that potential. We can reap the benefits of de-carbonisation and get there first. Jeremy Corbyn insists there must be better bus services across the country, rather than just in London, in order to reduce air pollution through car use. Si\u00e2n Berry accuses other parties of \u201cabstaining\u201d on climate change over aviation, arguing that the focus must be on targeting frequent flyers. Adam Price calls HS2 a \u201cvanity project\u201d, saying that Plaid Cymru do not support a third Heathrow airport runway either. Si\u00e2n Berry emphasises that the Greens want to cancel HS2, arguing that people want better public transport. Jeremy Corbyn argues that many people in the UK are hungry or obese due to food pricing, saying that we must extend biodiversity in UK farms. Adam Price of Plaid Cymru rejects the premise that we must reduce our dairy and meat intake, insisting that we need to be buying locally rather than importing. Nicola Sturgeon reminds the audience that half of international flights are taken by less than 10% of the population. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure that industry and government are leading by example, rather than focusing on individuals,\u201d the SNP leader said. Jo Swinson mentions the Liberal Democrats\u2019 policy of an international frequent flyer tax for those who take over three return flights a year. Green party co-leader Si\u00e2n Berry has accused Labour of \u201cweakening\u201d the goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2030. Jeremy Corbyn responded to say that Labour are not weakening the 2030 goal, but that the UK is only one country and it must be a global effort. Nicola Sturgeon insisted that the best way to tackle the climate crisis is not to be squabbling with one another. Jo Swinson emphasised the significance of remaining in the EU to tackle climate change. The climate debate on Channel 4 has now started. Clive Lewis, Labour\u2019s Treasury spokesman, has called the prime minister a \u201ccoward and a bully\u201d in response to the Conservative party\u2019s threats to Channel 4 over its broadcasting remit. He said: \u201cBoris Johnson is a coward and a bully. He thinks he is born to rule and is so used to getting his own way that he turns nasty when anyone dares challenge him. \u201cBritain deserves a prime minister that has enough of a backbone to face up to scrutiny.\u201d The Tories are threatening to review Channel 4\u2019s broadcasting remit if they win the general election, after the channel decided to replace Boris Johnson with a melting ice sculpture during its climate change debate tonight. Our media editor, Jim Waterson, has the full story: Michael Gove and the prime minister\u2019s father, Stanley Johnson, have turned up at the Channel 4 event, with Gove wanting to speak in the climate debate on behalf of the Conservatives. The broadcaster refused him entry on the basis that he is not a party leader. Ben de Pear, the editor of Channel 4 News, tweeted: Hayley Barlow, Channel 4\u2019s director of communications, said Gove was offered drinks and nibbles, but has now left the building. Jeremy Corbyn, Jo Swinson, Nicola Sturgeon, Sian Berry (Green party) and Adam Price (Plaid Cymru) are preparing for Channel 4\u2019s climate change debate which starts in less than half an hour. Both Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage are to be replaced with melting ice sculptures after they refused to attend. We will be keeping you updated on the debate via the live blog. Georgina Hayes is now taking over the live blog for the rest of the night Jeremy Corbyn has sought to play down reports that Labour is going to switch to fighting a more defensive campaign, putting more stress on policies that might appeal to leave voters. News of the change of tack emerged after the publication of the most-eagerly awaited poll of the campaign, a YouGov MRP analysis that suggests Boris Johnson is on course for a majority of 68. Speaking at an event in Southhampton, where he published Labour\u2019s environment manifesto, A Plan for Nature, Corbyn dismissed suggestions that this meant he would now have one message for leave voters, and another for remain voters. He told reporters: Our campaign is in every part of the country. I am travelling all around the country. I say the same thing at every place I go. I don\u2019t have one message for one group. I say the same message everywhere. Vote Labour in order to get a government that will deal with the inequalities and poverty and injustice austerity has heaped on this country. But the Guardian has been told that Labour is planning to change its approach, and having pursued a relatively offensive strategy (focusing on Tory-held seats), it now plans to concentrate more on shoring up the Labour vote in constituencies the party already holds. There have been reports saying that the party\u2019s private polling shows it is vulnerable in leave seats but - as ever - private polling mostly replicates the results of polling that gets released to the public, and the YouGov survey highlighted this exact point. Here is an extract form the write-up from YouGov\u2019s Anthony Wells: If the election were held today we project that the Tories would win 359 seats (a gain of 42 from 2017), Labour would win 211 (down by 51), the SNP 43 (up eight) and the Liberal Democrats 13 (a gain of one). Plaid Cymru would retain their four seats, the Greens would keep their single seat, and the Brexit party would not take any seats at all. As it stands, the swing to the Conservative party is bigger in areas that voted to leave in 2016, with the bulk of the projected Tory gains coming in the North and the urban West Midlands, as well as former mining seats in the East Midlands. At this point in the campaign, the Liberal Democrats have not made any real breakthrough \u2013 with our current projections showing that while they would pick up four seats they would lose three elsewhere. The survey has been acquired near-gospel status in the Westminster political system because in 2017 the YouGov MRP (multilevel regression and post-stratification) model (explained here, if you are interested) was about the one polling exercise that predicted a hung parliament. Perhaps this one will turn out to be accurate too, but there is no guarantee of that, and of course the campaign has another fortnight to run. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has attacked the spending plans of the UK\u2019s two main parties, saying neither election manifesto \u201cis a properly credible prospectus\u201d. As my colleague Larry Elliott explains in his analysis of the IFS verdict, its judgment was \u201cbrutal and even-handed: a plague on both your houses\u201d. There is a summary of what it said about the Tories\u2019 plans here, Labour\u2019s here and the Lib Dems\u2019 here. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, has sought to put Boris Johnson\u2019s character flaws at the heart of the election campaign by using a speech to argue that he is \u201cnot fit to be prime minister\u201d because he is selfish, dishonest and divisive. Jeremy Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister and SNP leader, Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, Adam Price, the Plaid Cymru leader and S\u00eean Berry, the Green co-leader, have been preparing for a Channel 4 News leaders\u2019 debate on the environment starting at 7pm. Boris Johnson has refused an invitation to appear, and reportedly Channel 4 is planning to replace him with an ice sculpture that should melt under the glare of the studio lights. There will be full coverage here. Conservative candidates in the general election have been issued with a detailed 17-page dossier on how to attack Labour and Liberal Democrat rivals which contains numerous rehashed and potentially misleading claims, the Guardian can reveal. You can read the full dossier embedded in our story here. Medics have called for guarantees that health will not be put at risk for profit after Labour released official documents that it said proved the NHS would be \u201con the table\u201d in trade talks with the US. Labour has deselected its candidate for Falkirk over alleged antisemitic posts on Facebook, leaving the party unable to contest a seat it once held for decades. An academic whose research was championed by the prime minister\u2019s key adviser Dominic Cummings has revealed he voted remain in the EU referendum and has hit out at the Conservatives\u2019 Brexit plans. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Georgina Hayes is now taking over. From the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Harry Cole Earlier in the comments MerlinUK was asking why the Guardian had not published the full text of the Tory briefing document, advising candidates how to attack Labour and Lib Dem rivals, mentioned in a story by my colleagues Hilary Osborne and Richard Partington. Well, we\u2019ve listened, and now we\u2019ve uploaded the whole document. It is embedded in the story, which is here. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has said he thinks Labour now accepts it cannot win the election. Speaking at a campaign event at a golf driving range earlier, and referring to reports that Labour has changed its campaign strategy, Farage said: I think the truth of it is, they realise they are now fighting a defensive battle, they know they can\u2019t win the election. This is now a defensive strategy to try to hold the seats that they have held for decades, it\u2019s almost an acceptance that they have lost the election. Wintry sun is shining in East Renfrewshire, but the cold not discouraging the canvassers. This constituency, south of Glasgow, was once a safe Labour seat for Jim Murphy. It is home to Scotland\u2019s largest Jewish community, returned a high remain vote in the EU referendum, and \u2013 according to last night\u2019s YouGov poll - will be one of only two seats which the SNP will win from the Scottish Conservatives next month. At a hustings organised by the Glasgow Jewish Representative Council on Wednesday night, the Labour candidate Carolann Davidson was blunt with the audience, reportedly telling them: I won\u2019t ask for your vote. We don\u2019t deserve it. The Labour party from the leadership down has failed you ... I am here tonight to reassure your community. Paul Masterton, for the Tories, described Jeremy Corbyn as \u201ca threat to this community\u201d, while his SNP challenger Kirsten Oswald described the Labour leader\u2019s handling of antisemitism as \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. Today Labour activists described Jewish voters telling them directly that they could not support them while Corbyn remains leader, while more broadly they are losing votes on two fronts: unionist voters to Tories and anti-Tory voters to the SNP. But SNP activists also note that the race remains very tight, and worry about people\u2019s exhaustion with Brexit impacting on turnout. Meanwhile, local Jewish groups welcomed the Labour candidate\u2019s honesty, but emphasised that the the party leadership had to be held to account too. They told the Guardian that anxiety and nervousness remained around the prospect of a Labour government. At the DUP election manifesto launch this morning Nigel Dodds, the DUP\u2019s deputy leader, called for an inquiry into the handling of the Brexit negotiations. He said: After this is done there should be a full proper inquiry set up at a high level into what went wrong with the British government negotiations. How can we have such a catastrophic conduct of negotiations in the most important issues of our time? There are remainers who would also like to see an inquiry into Brexit, going much further, but there is no sign at the moment of either man party expressing an interest in the idea. Labour received the most money in political donations in the second week of the election campaign, according to figures published by the Electoral Commission. Donations of more than \u00a37,500 have to be reported and in the period between 13 November and 19 November more than \u00a39m was donated in this way \u2013 up from \u00a36.5m the previous week. Labour received the most at \u00a33.5m, ahead of the Conservatives with \u00a33m and the Brexit party with \u00a32.3m. The Liberal Democrats received \u00a3251,000, Plaid Cymru \u00a370,000, the Greens \u00a337,750 and the SNP \u00a310,000. As the Press Association reports, the single biggest donation was \u00a33m from the Unite union to Labour. The Conservatives received 61 donations over \u00a37,500, the largest being from hedge fund manager Jonathan Wood, who gave \u00a3250,000. Two former Tory-backing businessmen donated to the Brexit party: Christopher Harborne, who gave \u00a32m, and Jeremy Hosking, who gave \u00a3250,000. When Boris Johnson raised the possibility of building a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, one engineer said the idea was \u201cbonkers\u201d. But, as the BBC\u2019s Mark Devenport points out, it is (tentatively) in the DUP manifesto. The manifesto is here (pdf). And this is what it says about the bridge. If the feasibility study on a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland concludes positively, this should also be pursued with the national government and devolved institutions working together to take it forward. This is very good on how Boris Johnson fights elections. It is a clip from Matthew McGregor, who worked for Labour on the Ken Livingstone campaign in 2008, when Johnson beat Livingstone for the London mayoralty. This morning Jo Swinson was also asked about the YouGov MRP polling analysis suggesting the Lib Dems may gain just one seat at the election. She claimed it showed there was still \u201ca huge amount to play for\u201d. She explained: What this poll shows is that there are 134 seats where either the Liberal Democrats are in first or second place as things stand. That shows there\u2019s a huge amount to play for. Jeremy Corbyn has not sought to make Boris Johnson\u2019s character an election issue. He has been fiercely critical of Johnson\u2019s policies, but he prides himself on being someone who does not resort to personal character assassination. He has summed up his attitude using the Michelle Obama\u2019s line \u201cWhen they go low, we go high\u201d (although that\u2019s a better slogan than it is a guide to how her husband won the 2012 election \u2013 but that\u2019s another story.) But the Liberal Democrats are targeting Johnson personally. Chuka Umunna, the party\u2019s foreign affairs spokesman, delivered a speech lambasting him on Monday, and this morning Jo Swinson, the party leader, followed that up with a speech entitled \u201cthe problem with Boris Johnson\u201d. She said he only cared about himself. Boris Johnson only cares about Boris Johnson. He will do whatever it takes, sacrifice whatever or whoever is needed to get what he wants. This is a man who decided which side to support in the EU referendum by game-playing what would be most likely to get him the keys to Number 10. His life has been about becoming prime minister. Not out of some burning desire to make people\u2019s lives better, but out of some sense of Etonian entitlement, because it\u2019s what people like him get to do. Boris Johnson doesn\u2019t care about you and your family. Just take the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. A British mother wrongfully imprisoned, a small child devastated, separated from her mum. When he was talking about that case, his words would be used against Nazanin at her trial. Swinson said Johnson was \u201cnot fit to be prime minister after lying to the Queen\u201d over prorogation. She went on: Boris Johnson is not fit to be prime minister not just because he doesn\u2019t care, not just because he lies, but also because he is complicit in stoking division and fear in our communities. Why else would Britain\u2019s biggest racist, Tommy Robinson, be supporting him? Honestly - such an endorsement would shame any decent person but Boris Johnson has no shame when it comes to the language he uses about race. Whether this will make much difference is another matter. Negative campaigning can be effective, but Johnson, like Donald Trump, seems to be unusually impervious to this sort of criticism. Some people loath him because of his multiple character flaws. But other people don\u2019t seem to mind ... Conservative candidates in the general election have been issued with a detailed dossier on how to attack Labour and Liberal Democrat rivals, which contains numerous rehashed and potentially misleading claims, the Guardian can reveal. My colleagues Hilary Osborne and Richard Partington have the story here. On Tuesday, when responding to the Times article by the chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, saying he had allowed the \u201cpoison\u201d of antisemitism to take root in Labour, Jeremy Corbyn was careful not to criticise Mirvis personally, or to question his right to speak out. Instead Corbyn just stressed his opposition to antisemitism, and explained what he had done to tackle the problem. But on the World at One at few minutes ago Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary and Corbyn\u2019s most influential ally in the union movement, went a bit further. He said that he disagreed with Mirvis; but he also implied that Mirvis was wrong to speak out in this way during an election. Commenting on the chief rabbi\u2019s article, McCluskey said: I think that was wrong, and quite extraordinary that a religious leader should come out and say that ... The reality is this; everybody should be concerned and sorry about the type of hurt that has been caused [to] the Jewish community. And Labour has fought, Jeremy has fought, I\u2019ve fought all my life against antisemitism. Labour has now very robust procedures to deal with anybody. We don\u2019t want a single antisemite in the Labour party. So that is the message. When it was put to him that Mirvis would not have spoken out if he did not think there was a problem, McCluskey replied: I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what he believes, if he said it. I just absolutely fundamentally disagree with him. This is what Sajid Javid, the chancellor, said this morning about the IFS criticism of the Tories\u2019 election plans. (See 9.50am, 10am and 10.45am.) In response to claims that the party was not being \u201chonest\u201d about its plans, he said: We have also clearly set out exactly how we are going to fund them. We have a very detailed costings document \u2013 the most detailed I would say that any party has published in any British election \u2013 so I\u2019m very confident about that. The claim that the Conservative party\u2019s manifesto costings document is \u201cthe most detailed\u201d ever is dubious. The document (pdf) runs to nine pages, and does contain costings for the manifesto promises. But the Labour equivalent (pdf) runs to 40 pages and it includes an analysis taking into account behavioural responses (ie, how changes to tax rates will impact on the number of people paying those tax rates, and the likely consequences for the exchequer). The Tory document does not contain this level of detail. Unionists in Northern Ireland are united in opposition to Boris Johnson\u2019s proposed Brexit deal, Nigel Dodds, the DUP\u2019s deputy leader, said this morning. Speaking at the launch of his party\u2019s election manifesto in Belfast, he said unionists would not accept plans that would effectively create a customs border in the Irish Sea. He said: There can be no borders in the Irish Sea. We will work to try to get a sensible Brexit deal. But it cannot erect new barriers. We need our people to come together, not create more division. The DUP\u2019s manifesto is also explicit on this. It says: The east-west checks as proposed would lead to excessively bureaucratic burdens for trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and consequently higher prices and less choice for consumers as GB businesses opt for \u2018not available in Northern Ireland\u2019. The latest Scottish opinion poll has given Nicola Sturgeon a mid-campaign boost by puting the Scottish National party at 44%, its highest rating since the 2017 election. The Ipsos Mori poll for STV has more grim news for Labour, putting its support at 16%. The Ipsos poll also found the Conservatives have secured 26% of the vote, consistent with other recent polls, while the Liberal Democrats have failed to capitalise on Scotland\u2019s strong pro-European sentiment, polling at just 11%. Only six months after the Brexit party won a Scottish seat in the European parliament with 14.8% of the vote, Ipsos found its support in Scotland now too low to be effectively measured: it puts it at under 1%. The Ipsos poll, one of the few done by random telephone surveys, has a chink of light for Labour and the Lib Dems. It said 23% of the 1,046 voters it polled last week have yet to make up their mind. While 84% of Tory and SNP voters have decided, only 73% of Labour supporters and 66% of Lib Dems were sure which way they would vote. Even so, it suggests recent polls forecasting another dire election for Scottish Labour are correct. Yesterday\u2019s YouGov poll for the Times predicted Labour will only retain two of its seven seats, in Edinburgh South and Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill. Others say Labour can only save Edinburgh South, a seat held by the Scottish party\u2019s most vehement critic of Jeremy Corbyn, Ian Murray. Ipsos asked respondents to spontaneously list the most important topics for them at the election: 72% of Tories and 79% of Lib Dems put Brexit first; 67% of Labour voters prioritised the NHS, followed by Brexit, and 55% of SNP voters put Brexit first, with 46% mentioning independence and 45% the NHS. It said Sturgeon was the only party leader not to have a negative satisfaction rating, but voters were split 48% to 48% on whether she was doing a good or bad job. Boris Johnson had a net satisfaction rating of -52, with 23% of Tory voters disliking him, while Jeremy Corbyn was -47, with 41% of Labour voters dissatisfied with him. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, appears to be less unpopular in Scotland than other UK polls suggest. While 25% of voters had no opinion of her, her net satisfaction rating was the best of the UK leaders at -21%. Q: The IFS says some of the Waspi women who will benefit from your \u00a358bn compensation are quite well off. And getting rid of tuition fees will help the rich rather than the poor. Are you happy about your manifesto choices, when you could be spending more reversing benefit cuts. Corbyn says the Waspi women were very badly treated. This is a specific cohort of people. Some of them have been driven into stress and deep debt by what happened. He says he has met them. They are living difficult lives. Some tried to go back to work, and were told to try apprenticeships. He says he thinks the treatment of them has been \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. It is moral duty to pay them. Corbyn says the question challenges the principle of universality. He says he wants education to be a right for everyone. He will end universal credit, the two-child policy, the rape clause, and the wait to get benefits, he says. Q: Your tree-planting policy implies 190 trees being planted every minute. Is it realistic? Corbyn says he is not talking about one person doing the planting. It is a massive commitment, he admits. Q: Do you support the Southampton airport extension? Corbyn says any airport expansions under Labour will have to meet tests of sustainability, air pollution, noise pollution and traffic. He says rail connectivity has improved. He has looked at prices for going to Berlin. A train fare costs \u00a3200. But you can fly for \u00a319. That\u2019s not right, he says. He says his green manifesto, a Plan for Nature, is a serious plan. But government cannot implement it on its own. It needs communities to help, he says. And that\u2019s it. The Q&amp;A has finished. Q: In Southampton the Labour council recently abandoned plans to charge the most polluting vehicles being driven in the city. Shouldn\u2019t councils be adopting ambitious policies in this regard? Corbyn says he wants to give councils more power to integrate their transport systems, particularly bus services. Q: Won\u2019t creating a new national park in Dorset lead to more visitors coming to an already popular, making traffic and pollution worse? Corbyn says Dorset is an incredibly beautiful area. He mentions Chesil beach in particular. He says making the area a national park would mean more money being available, and better controls. It would be there for all people. He says it was the postwar Labour government that introduced national parks. And Chris Smith introduced the right to roam. Everyone should be able to enjoy the countryside, he says. Q: How confident are you of gaining seats in the south? You have come through Dorset, which is as blue as it gets. Corbyn says his message is for the whole country. He is confident of winning. He wants to see two Labour MPs in Southampton. (At the moment one is Labour and one is Tory.) Jeremy Corbyn is now taking questions. Q: What is your message to traditional Labour supporters who may be considering backing the Tories over Brexit? Q: We have been told you are shifting strategy, to focus more on leave voters. Does that mean your campaign is not worked so far? Corbyn says environmental problems can only be addressed on an international basis. He says his plans on Brexit are \u201cabsolutely clear\u201d. He summarises them: negotiating a new Brexit deal within three months, and holding a referendum within six months. As PM, he would make sure the referendum was fairly held, he says. He says people have got to come together. He says he will take this message to every part of the country. And he says he has the same message everywhere. He does not say one thing in one place, and another thing in another. This point seems designed to address this CCHQ attack line. Q: Downing Street has a big garden. How many trees would you plant personally if you become PM? Corbyn says he has a nice hornbeam tree in a pot in his back garden. It was given to him by climate crisis protesters. He suggests the No 10 garden would be a really good place to plant it. Q: The IFS says your plans are not credible. If they don\u2019t believe you, why should the public? Corbyn says the Labour manifesto is fully costed. He says he is happy to have it scrutinised. And here is his peroration. We are living in the jaws of a climate and environment emergency. We cannot afford more wasted years of Conservative inaction from a government bought and paid for by the big polluters and the billionaires. Labour is on your side and on the side of the environment. Our Plan for Nature is a radical and innovative response to the emergency we face and it\u2019s just part of the green transformation of our economy and society that a Labour government will bring about. The future is ours to make provided we act now. Together, we can change course and leave a country and a planet that\u2019s fit for the next generation. Corbyn says he wants to protect habitats. We\u2019ll expand and restore our habitats and plant trees so that we can create natural solutions to bring down emissions and allow our wildlife to flourish, because currently wildlife is in crisis. Since 1970 the turtle dove population in Britain has declined by 97%. Animals that are part of our national culture are in frightening decline: the hedgehog, the natterjack toad and the red squirrel. Once these native species disappear they don\u2019t come back. We\u2019ll take specific steps to protect and restore their populations. And on animal welfare we\u2019ll ban fur, end the use of cruel snares and halt the badger cull. And unlike the Conservatives you can trust that Labour will never allow the return of fox hunting. We mistakenly left out Plaid Cymru in the post about parties taking part in tonight\u2019s climate crisis debate on Channel 4 tonight (see 9.28am). The post has now been changed. Corbyn also confirms the plan to plant 2bn trees over the next 20 years. Because a Labour government will set a target to plant 2 billion trees by 2040, starting with 300 million in our first term. We\u2019ll plant trees in national parks, we\u2019ll plant them in the national forest, which we\u2019ll look to extend to Sherwood Forest. We\u2019ll plant a million new trees on land owned by the health service, creating an NHS forest and we\u2019ll work with communities to plant trees in towns and cities too. These will be mixed native species creating wildlife-rich woodlands. Corbyn is now confirming the plans for 10 new national parks. A Labour government will create ten brand new national parks, increasing the total size of our national parks by 50% meaning three-quarters of people will live within 30 minutes of a national park. We will consult widely on the exact locations of the parks but obvious candidates include: the Cotswolds, the Chilterns, the North and South Pennines, Coastal Suffolk, Coastal Dorset, and the Lincolnshire Wolds. A new authority will be tasked with ensuring the parks help tackle the climate crisis and restore nature but they will also be for leisure and for beauty. When Labour created the first national parks in the wake of world war two it was part of a radical plan to open up the best of our nation to everyone, from all walks of life. That\u2019s the spirit that a Labour government will take forward as we create ten more parks ... giving people access to the green spaces so vital for our collective wellbeing and mental health. Our country is defined by its beautiful landscapes its rolling hills rugged coastlines and idyllic woodlands. Travelling around Britain by train as I do, I am so often in awe of the beauty that exists right here at home. A Labour government will protect that landscape which is so precious to us all. Corbyn says government must tackle this crisis now. As David Attenborough said earlier this year: \u201cWe now stand at a unique point in our planet\u2019s history, where we must all share responsibility ... for the future of life on earth.\u201d We have a choice. We can shut our eyes, cross our fingers and entrust our fate to a system that has already driven our planet to the brink of catastrophe. Or we can do everything possible to tackle the biggest threat we face. That means taking on the big polluters who profit from the current system. If we flinch, then we will be handing down a broken planet to our children. Bringing our carbon emissions down to net zero won\u2019t happen by itself. It will only be possible with massive public investment in renewable energy and green technology. So a Labour government will bring about a green industrial revolution creating a million new, skilled, green jobs. One million jobs; from building wind turbines, to insulting homes, from reforesting the Great British countryside, to manufacturing new electric vehicles. Corbyn is now talking about the climate crisis. I\u2019ve been deeply moved to see school children taking to the streets to protest about climate breakdown and I\u2019m pleased we have some climate strikers here with us today. For someone of my generation it\u2019s inspiring but also humbling to see children teaching the adults a lesson. But I\u2019m proud that Labour has responded leading the British parliament to become the first in the world to declare a climate and environment emergency. We can see the effects of that emergency all around us as the recent flooding in Yorkshire and the East Midlands tragically brought home with the death of Annie Hall. A Labour government will invest in flood defences especially in areas like the North West, Yorkshire and the East Midlands that have been shamefully neglected by the Conservatives. The reality is this election is our last chance to tackle the climate and environment emergency. Corbyn says the Tories have been caught \u201ctrying to cover things up\u201d. Yesterday Labour exposed \u201ca secret plot\u201d to sell out the NHS, he says. He repeats the point he made in his speech yesterday about how he thinks the dossier released yesterday has \u201cshredded\u201d his claim that the NHS will not be on the table in UK-US trade talks. He says \u201cthis election is now a fight for the survival of our NHS as a public service.\u201d (This is a claim that Labour tends to end up making at almost every election. Although it normally has some validity, when put like this it tends to be hyperbolic. Conservative governments have often been elected, and the NHS has survived as a public service.) Jennie Formby, Labour\u2019s general secretary, is introducing Jeremy Corbyn. She describes Southampton as her home town. She introduces Corbyn as \u201cthe most decent, honest and inclusive man I know\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn is about to give a speech in Southampton on the environment. There is a live feed at the top of the blog. Around 212,000 more people moved to the UK long-term in the last year than left, according to the latest estimates. As the Press Association reports, the net migration figures for the year ending in June, which looked at people coming to the country with the intention to stay for 12 months or more, were published by the Office for National Statistics this morning. After peak levels of more than 200,000 in 2015 and early 2016, EU net migration has dropped and now stands at 48,000 in the same period. This is largely because of a fall in EU immigration, which remains at its lowest level since the year ending March 2013, PA Media reports. In an interview on the Today programme this morning, focusing mostly on the dossier published yesterday revealing what has been said about health policy in the UK-US talks about a possible trade deal, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said drug prices would not be on the table in talks on a UK-US trade deal. He said: In terms of drug pricing, we\u2019ve said in our manifesto the price the NHS pays for drugs will not be on the table. Asked why the leaked dossier does not say that the NHS and drugs prices would be exempt from the trade talks, Hancock replied: There was no need to say that because our position is absolutely crystal clear. This is what the Conservative manifesto (pdf) says about the proposed trade deal and the NHS. When we are negotiating trade deals, the NHS will not be on the table. The price the NHS pays for drugs will not be on the table. The services the NHS provides will not be on the table. Here is my colleague Kate Proctor, who has produced a fun video about whether or not holding a general election in December is a terrible idea. And this is what Paul Johnson, the IFS director, said about Lib Dem manifesto plans in his opening presentation. The Lib Dems would almost quintuple spending on universal free childcare, the IFS says, \u201ccreating a whole new leg of the universal welfare state\u201d. The IFS says the Lib Dem plan to put a penny on the main rates of income tax is \u201csimple, progressive and would raise a secure level of revenue\u201d. The Lib Dems\u2019 plans imply lower borrowing than under Labour or the Tories, the IFS says. Johnson says: They would appear to be the only one of these three parties which would put debt on a decisively downward path. And this is what Paul Johnson, the IFS director, said about Labour\u2019s plan in his opening presentation. It is \u201chighly likely\u201d that, at least over the longer-term, Labour would need to raise taxes beyond the measures already announced, the IFS says. And it says Labour would \u201cclearly increase taxes for many millions outside the top 5%\u201d. Even though Labour would increase the size of the state, it would still leave the UK\u2019s public spending as a proportion of national income lower than Germany\u2019s, the IFS says. It is \u201cfar too simplistic\u201d to assume that Labour\u2019s plans would increase growth, the IFS says. That is because, even though Labour would boost investment and pursue a softer Brexit, the scale of its ambition creates uncertainty. Labour\u2019s plan to abolish in-work poverty within a parliament is \u201cnot achievable\u201d, the IFS says. It says the party\u2019s plans for working-age welfare spending are \u201crelatively modest\u201d, undoing \u201conly just over half the cuts implemented since 2015 and less than a quarter of those put in place since 2010\u201d. But in the longer term Labour\u2019s policies would probably \u201creduce labour market inequality and hence in-work poverty, possibly risking slower increases in average earnings\u201d, the IFS says. The IFS says Labour\u2019s plan to completely replace universal credit is \u201cunwise\u201d. It says it would be \u201cexpensive, disruptive and unnecessary\u201d. Labour would double current spending on universal free childcare, the IFS says. The IFS is very critical of the decision to spend \u00a358bn compensation the Waspi (Women against state pension inequality) women. Johnson says: While many were not aware their state pension age was rising, and some have clearly suffered hardship as a result, the decision was taken at least 15 years before the increase in pension age and most in the group are relatively well off. To believe the whole group should receive compensation is a recipe for complete stasis in policy. How can you ever defend any policy which ever makes anyone worse off if you think this change in pension age, implemented with 15 years notice, designed to equalise treatment between men and women, and in the face of dramatic increases in life expectancy, is in some sense unethical? The Labour plan to keep the state pension age at 66 is \u201can expensive promise\u201d, the IFS says. Labour\u2019s corporation tax plan would increase corporate tax revenues to \u201ctheir highest ever in the UK and to among the highest in the developed world\u201d, the IFS says. It says Labour\u2019s plans to change the taxation of dividends and capital gains are \u201cvery welcome\u201d and would raise revenue. The Labour plan for inclusive ownership funds, taking 10% of big firms\u2019s share and allocating them for the workers and for government, would probably lead to companies reducing pay to compensate. And here is a fuller summary of what Paul Johnson, the Institute for Fiscal Studies director, was saying about the Tory manifesto plans in his opening presentation. At one point he said that the IFS would be saying a lot more about the Labour plans than the Tory plans. That was not the result of any bias, for or against, he explained. It was just a consequence of Labour having released much more detail about its plans, he said. The Tory plans are a lot more sketchy. IFS on Conservative plans It is \u201chighly likely\u201d the Tories would end up spending more than their manifesto implies, \u201cand thus taxing and borrowing more\u201d, the IFS says. Public spending under the current government is much closer to what Labour promised in its 2017 manifesto than what the Tories promised in their own manifesto, the IFS says. Johnson says: Current public service spending is due to be around \u00a327 billion higher next year than implied by their 2017 manifesto. That\u2019s closer to the 2017 Labour pledge than to the Conservatives\u2019 own manifesto. But Tory spending plans would not reverse austerity, the IFS says. Johnson says: Conservative plans if delivered would leave public service spending outside of health still 14% lower in 2023-24 than it was in 2010-11. No more austerity perhaps, but an awful lot of it baked in. There is a risk of an effective no deal Brexit at the end of 2020 under the Tories, the IFS says. It says this would harm the economy and increase the deficit and debt. The Tories have \u201cfailed to come up with any kind of plan or any kind of money for social care\u201d, the IFS says. Tory plans on welfare are \u201call but non-existent\u201d, the IFS says. It says the Tory plans for tax and spending will suit people who \u201cthink things are pretty much okay as they are\u201d. And here is Paul Johnson\u2019s conclusion from his opening presentation at the IFS briefing. The implication of the Conservative manifesto is that they believe most aspects of public policy are just fine as they are. Little in the way of changes to tax, spending, welfare or anything else. Yes, there are some spending increases for health and education already promised, but essentially nothing new in the manifesto. Labour, by contrast, want to change everything. Their vision is of a state with a far greater role than anything we have seen for more than 40 years. They would tax and spend more than ever before, putting in place a new universal welfare state with free childcare, free university, free personal care, free prescriptions and more besides; they would impose a swathe of new labour market regulations; their minimum wage would directly set the wages of a quarter of private sector workers; they would nationalise a series of companies whose performance is of vital importance to the UK economy; they would enforce transfer of effective ownership of 10% of large companies from current owners to a combination of employees and government. For good or bad five years of Labour government would involve enormous economic and social change. In the face of such vast ambition from Labour, one should not forget that the Liberal Democrat manifesto is itself a radical document that would involve a decisive move away from the policies of the past decade. Rarely can a starker choice have been placed before the UK electorate. Here is more from Paul Johnson\u2019s opening presentation at the Institute for Fiscal Studies\u2019 briefing. All other countries which tax and spend on the scale that Labour proposes have tax systems which levy more tax on the average worker than we do. Liberal Democrat proposals to put a penny on the main rates of income tax would be simple, progressive and would raise a secure level of revenue. While the Conservatives continue to pretend that tax rises will never be needed to secure decent public services, Labour pretends that huge increases in spending can be financed by just big companies and the rich. In this respect neither Labour nor the Conservatives is being honest with the electorate. Here is my colleague Julia Kollewe\u2019s story about the IFS analysis. In his opening remarks at the Institute for Fiscal Studies briefing Paul Johnson, the IFS, director, said neither the Tory nor the Labour manifesto plans were \u201cproperly credible\u201d. He said (bold type in original IFS text): Neither [the Conservative manifesto nor the Labour manifesto] is a properly credible prospectus. Should they win this time it is highly likely that the Conservatives would end up spending more than their manifesto implies and thus taxing or borrowing more. The chances of holding spending down as they propose over a five-year parliament look remote. Why have they been so immensely modest in their proposals? Because to do otherwise would either mean resiling from their pledge to balance the current budget or would mean being up front about the need for tax rises to avoid breaking that pledge. Labour would not be able to deliver investment spending increases on the scale they promise. The public sector doesn\u2019t have the capacity to ramp up that much, that fast. It is highly likely that Labour, at least over the longer-term, would need to implement other tax raising measures in order to raise the \u00a380bn of tax revenue that they want and even just sticking to those proposals they would clearly increase taxes for many millions outside the top 5%. In reality, a change in the scale and scope of the state that they propose would require more broad-based tax increases at some point. Labour has deselected its election candidate for Falkirk for allegedly putting antisemitic posts on Facebook, leaving the party unable to contest a seat it once held for decades. Scottish Labour officials confirmed a report in the Falkirk Herald it had dropped Safia Ali as a candidate and suspended her party membership after past antisemitic posts on Facebook surfaced, in the latest controversy about candidate selections. Michael Sharpe, Scottish Labour\u2019s general secretary, told the Falkirk Herald: I deeply regret the people of the Falkirk constituency will no longer have a Labour candidate to campaign and vote for on 12 December 12. There is no place for antisemitism, or any form of racism and bigotry, in our party. That is why Labour is taking robust action to root it out of our movement and wider society. Ali had stood as an independent candidate for the Carse, Kinnaird and Tryst ward in a local election to Falkirk council in 2017, getting the lowest number of first-preference votes. A party source said the comments were made on an older Facebook account she no longer used, and had not been picked up during candidate screening. He said the case was going through the fast-track disciplinary processes introduced by Jeremy Corbyn. \u201cSafia Ali is no longer the Labour party\u2019s candidate for Falkirk,\u201d a party spokesman said. \u201cWe have taken immediate action on this matter.\u201d Labour\u2019s Falkirk constituency party was embroiled in a controversy over irregularities in member recruitment involving the Unite union when the union wanted Karie Murphy, an ally of Unite leader Len McCluskey and latterly a key aide to Corbyn, chosen as its candidate. The constituency party was put under special measures. In 2015, it was amongst the swathe of Labour seats to topple in the Scottish National party landslide and was held by the SNP\u2019s John McNally in 2017 with a 4,923 vote majority. The seat has since been low on Labour\u2019s target list in Scotland. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has just started its press conference to present its analysis of the main parties\u2019 election manifestos. There is a live feed here. Boris Johnson is facing growing criticism for refusing to take part in tonight\u2019s climate crisis leaders\u2019 debate on Channel 4. Nicolas Stern, author of a landmark climate report, said it was crucial that all political leaders showed up for the debate to give voters the chance to see how future governments would respond to the unfolding emergency. Climate change and biodiversity are critical issues for both the UK and the world, and it is crucial that all our political party leaders take part in the groundbreaking debate. Stern, a crossbench member of the House of Lords and Chair of the Grantham Research Institute at the LSE, said voters had a right to hear \u201ca more detailed discussion between the leaders about how their governments would rise to challenges of acting with the urgency and scale demanded by these issues\u201d. For many voters, particularly young ones, climate change and nature are two of the most important issues at this election and they should be well-informed about each leader\u2019s views about them when they vote. The hour-long debate will be held tonight on Channel 4 at 7pm. Jeremy Corbyn and the leaders of the SNP, Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and the Green party have all agreed to take part. The decision of Johnson not to take part comes amid increasingly alarming news on the scale of the emergency. On Wednesday scientists warned that the world may already have crossed a series of climate tipping points posing \u201can existential threat to civilisation\u201d. The Green party\u2019s Caroline Lucas said: It\u2019s outrageous that he can\u2019t spare an hour to address the greatest challenges of our time. How are we supposed to trust the prime minister\u2019s word that he\u2019s taking climate and nature emergency seriously? Max Wakefield, director at Possible, which led the campaign for a climate debate, said: \u201cIt is not too late for the prime minister to do as the public wants and turn up to debate the climate and nature emergency.\u201d Here is my colleague Heather Stewart\u2019s story about the new Labour strategy. Here are the campaign events in the diary for today. 9.30am: The Institute for Fiscal Studies publishes an analysis of the main parties\u2019 manifestos. 10.30am: The DUP launches its election manifesto. 11am: Jeremy Corbyn gives a speech on the environment. He will announce plans to plant 2bn trees by 2040. 11am: Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, campaigns in Hull. 11.30am: Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, gives a speech on \u201cthe problem with Boris Johnson\u201d. 12.30pm: Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, and Nia Griffith, his Labour shadow, take part in a defence hustings organised by the Royal United Services Institute. 7pm: Jeremy Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon, Jo Swinson, Si\u00e2n Berry and Adam Price take part in a Channel 4 News leaders\u2019 debate on the environment. Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage are planning to stay away. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Jedidajah Otte We have already mentioned Iain Watson\u2019s report for the BBC on how Labour plans to revise its campaign to focus more on appealing to leave voters. His full report is here. And here is an extract. The message will be that Labour\u2019s leave deal would offer voters a genuine choice - and that a new referendum will not be an attempt to remain in the EU by the back door. There will be an attempt to explain the deal Labour is seeking to negotiate \u2013 and that it would protect workers\u2019 rights. In other words, the party leadership is not opposing Brexit by opposing Boris Johnson\u2019s deal \u2013 it simply wants to find what it regards as a better one. That may be a tricky argument, compared with the simplicity of the Conservative message of getting Brexit \u201cdone\u201d. But it is felt that reassurance for leave voters is necessary. And here is the Press Association version of the story. The Labour party has hit the reset button amid the latest polling saying the Tories are on course to win the general election. The party is understood to be changing tack in its campaign, particularly in leave-voting areas, where it is in danger of losing seats to the Conservatives. Labour insiders say a key mistake up until now was overestimating the electoral threat from the Liberal Democrats, and underestimating the likelihood of leave voters switching from Labour to the Conservatives, the BBC has reported. Labour\u2019s strategy so far had been \u2013 in part \u2013 to emphasise that the election is about more than Brexit and to get voters to focus on issues which would unite Labour voters in leave and remain areas. The new plan is designed to appeal to those who voted for Brexit, and to try to convince them that Labour is not attempting to stop Brexit by offering another referendum. Shadow cabinet members who back a leave deal rather than remain will have a higher profile in the final two weeks of the campaign. Jeremy Corbyn and party chairman, Ian Lavery, who favours leaving the EU with a deal, will tour leave areas to try to explain the deal Labour wants to negotiate and emphasise that they will protect workers\u2019 rights. Quite how much actual change we will witness in Labour campaigning remains to be seen. After all, it is not as if shadow cabinet ministers who are strongly remain have been given a high profile anyway. (Keir Starmer has been almost as invisible as Jacob Rees-Mogg in the last few weeks.) And what is being described is not a new policy, but just a subtle shift in emphasis. Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, was asked about the BBC story when he was on the Today programme. He claimed he did not know anything about a shift in strategy, but he did not contest the accuracy of the story in any way. Both the Tories and Labour are likely to break their own spending rules, the Resolution Foundation said in a new report published today. RF is an independent thinktank focused on improving the living standards of those on low to middle incomes. The Tories have promised to balance the budget within three years, Labour said it would do so within five years. The analysis suggests that the Tories are failing to account for \u201ccosts associated with their new investment plans\u201d and \u201cincreased interest payments\u201d and \u201cadditional depreciation cost of \u00a32.3bn per year by 2023-24\u201d. The Tory manifesto does also not include any funding for the pledged \u00a36bn increase of the national insurance threshold to \u00a312,500. Labour\u2019s manifesto on the other hand \u201cfailed to account for the additional \u00a312bn annual cost from its commitment to compensate women born in the 1950s affected by the increase in the state pension age\u201d, the report stated. Labour\u2019s investment plans would mean its budget balancing headroom has already been more than used up, the report added. Labour has called the report inaccurate. The BBC\u2019s Ian Watson just said on Today that Labour voters living in leave areas will \u201clikely see a very different style of campaign\u201d from the party over the next two weeks, as \u201cthe Lib Dem threat was overestimated, while the willingness of leave voters to switch from Labour to the Conseravtives was underestimated\u201d. More Labour activists are set to be moved into leave areas, he said, and that shadow cabinet members backing a leave deal rather than remain will be given a higher profile. The message will be that a new referendum won\u2019t be a \u201cback door\u201d initiative to remain in the EU, Watson added. Laura Duffell from the Royal College of Nursing told Sky\u2019s Breakfast show this morning that she and her colleagues had doubts about the 50,000 extra NHS nurses that were promised in the Conservative manifesto. \u201cI\u2019d really like to know where the 50,000 nurses are coming from. [...] If there are 50,000 nurses out there, why do we not see them already? It\u2019s not an overnight fix,\u201d Duffell said. Rabbi Jonathan Sacks just spoke about the widely reported incident on the London underground from a few days ago, where a Jewish family was subjected to antisemitic verbal abuse from a man, before other passengers intervened. The man was later arrested. \u201cThe hero was a young Muslim woman wearing a hijab,\u201d Sacks said. \u201cShe chose to identify with the Jewish family.\u201d \u201cShe chose not to be a bystander but chose to confront racism head on,\u201d he added. Labour\u2019s Barry Gardiner is on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Quizzed on the YouGov MRP poll result and Labour\u2019s reported change of tactic, with the aim to convince more Labour leave voters, Gardiner says he hasn\u2019t heard of anything about a change in campaign tactics. He says the margins have \u201cnarrowed\u201d in recent weeks, and that Labour is the only party trying to unite the country around a compromise: a final say on any Brexit deal. This from Sky\u2019s Tamara Cohen: Hello, I\u2019m taking over from my colleague Kate Lyons now. Many people wonder this morning how accurate the YouGov MRP poll predicting a comfortable Tory majority might be, as well as how accurate any polling can be. This from political journalist Conor Pope: This from Prospect editor Tom Clark, who is urging caution: And this from the journalist Paul Mason: There\u2019s a bit of drama going down about whether or not Boris Johnson will do an interview with Andrew Neil. As Jim Waterson and Heather Stewart write: Labour has expressed concerns about the BBC\u2019s political coverage after it was revealed that Boris Johnson has still not confirmed whether he will subject himself to a cross-examination by Andrew Neil. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s team agreed to take part in the series of one-on-one interviews with the journalist after the BBC told them the prime minister would definitely be doing a similar broadcast next week. However, a BBC source strongly denied they had told Labour that Johnson had confirmed. The BBC has yet to confirm the date of Johnson\u2019s appearance, leading to Labour concerns that Johnson could be tempted to sidestep scrutiny from one of the broadcaster\u2019s leading political interviewers. Nicola Sturgeon responded asking whether Johnson was ducking out because he was a chicken. Jeremy Corbyn supporter and Guardian columnist Owen Jones called it an \u201cabsolute disgrace\u201d, saying the BBC had \u201clied to Labour and said they\u2019d agreed an interview between Andrew Neil and Boris Johnson next week\u201d \u2013 a claim the BBC denies, and Labour candidates are piling on. What\u2019s happening today? Jo Swinson starts the day with a roundtable on homelessness in London and Jeremy Corbyn will be in Southampton to announce the party\u2019s environment policies. A foreign policy debate, featuring the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, as well as the foreign affairs spokespersons for the Lib Dems and SNP. If you\u2019re interested, that will be broadcast on Radio 4 tonight. Tonight, party leaders will participate in a debate on the climate crisis, broadcast on Channel 4. Boris Johnson has not confirmed whether he will be there and Nigel Farage has rejected the invite, but all other parties will be attending. A quiet day for the Tories, who have no major events or announcements scheduled. A new poll for the Times points to a thumping Conservative victory. While the Guardian is treating all polls with suspicion, read why here, the MRP poll from YouGov came closest to calling the unexpected result of the 2017 general election. The poll predicts the Conservatives will win 359 seats (42 gains), leaving Johnson with a majority of 68. Labour, meanwhile, would fall back to 211 seats \u2013 a result that would be in line with the disaster of 1983. Not everyone is happy with that message, including Boris Johnson\u2019s adviser Dominic Cummings who has told Brexit supporters that the general election is \u201cmuch tighter\u201d than polls might suggest and urged them to persuade their friends to vote Tory. Matt Hancock is up early, talking about Conservative plans to tackle addiction. Good morning politics people. We\u2019re two weeks out from the vote and Labour has taken the gloves off, accusing the Tories of being willing to sell off the NHS. Meanwhile, there\u2019ll be a lot of talk about the climate crisis today, as scientists warn the world may already have crossed a series of climate tipping points, meaning \u201cwe are in a state of planetary emergency\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn has returned to his deadliest line of attack in this election campaign, as he claims that leaked documents show Boris Johnson wants to sell off the NHS in a trade deal with the US. The official papers reveal US and UK officials have repeatedly discussed dismantling protections that keep NHS drug prices down as part of their negotiations about a post-Brexit trade deal. The Labour leader, and some experts, say that the official papers put lie to Johnson\u2019s repeated claims that the NHS is not for sale and that healthcare is \u201cnot on the table\u201d in trade talks between the two countries. Denis Campbell and Jamie Grierson have unpacked what the dossier says and what it means. Heather Stewart writes that \u201cCorbyn had one central aim as he brandished the 451-page \u2018secret\u201d NHS document at a hastily-arranged press conference on Wednesday: to drag the general election debate safely back into Labour\u2019s comfort zone after the antisemitism accusations. Today will be about the environment. Corbyn will be in Southampton where he will set out the party\u2019s environment policies, arguing that the UK should plant 2bn trees by 2040. One plank of Labour\u2019s energy policy is under fire today, as lawyers have warned that the party\u2019s plans to take large parts of the energy industry back under public control puts it on a collision course with EU laws that guard Europe-owned companies against government takeovers. Later tonight, the leaders of most parties \u2013 Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage are the notable exceptions \u2013 will participate in a Channel 4 debate on climate issues.",
